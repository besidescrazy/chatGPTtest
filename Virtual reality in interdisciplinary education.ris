AB  - Virtual reality is widely used in the industry and is becoming more and more affordable for end users. At the same time higher education students want to be well-prepared for their professional life and expect more courses with practical application of theoretical knowledge acquired during their studies. Moreover, they benefit greatly when having the possibility to improve their soft skills.
   This paper presents the teaching methodology for a practical course in virtual reality for graduate and undergraduate students. The course design focuses on learning about virtual reality by simulating interdisciplinary industrial projects and it aims at developing skills such as methodical approach to practical engineering problems, teamwork, working in interdisciplinary groups and time management. In addition the paper discusses the importance of the course design, task specification and work group composition for a successful realization of the course and refers to some project examples from the past three years.

AB  - The successful development and classroom integration of Virtual (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) learning environments requires competencies and content knowledge with respect to media didactics and the respective technologies. The paper discusses a pedagogical concept specifically aiming at the interdisciplinary education of pre-service teachers in collaboration with human-computer interaction students. The students' overarching goal is the interdisciplinary realization and integration of VR/AR learning environments in teaching and learning concepts. To assist this approach, we developed a specific tutorial guiding the developmental process. We evaluate and validate the effectiveness of the overall pedagogical concept by analyzing the change in attitudes regarding 1) the use of VR/AR for educational purposes and in competencies and content knowledge regarding 2) media didactics and 3) technology. Our results indicate a significant improvement in the knowledge of media didactics and technology. We further report on four STEM learning environments that have been developed during the seminar.

AB  - Place-based education (PBE) has long been recognized as a high-impact educational practice. It embeds learning in a multi-sensory context that nurtures active, praxis-driven, interdisciplinary, and collaborative learning. More recently, educators have begun to utilize digital media and virtual reality technologies in ways that seem to parallel PBE. Using phenomenological concepts, especially following Edmund Husserl and Alfred Schutz, this chapter explores what the parallels and differences might be between physical and virtual places, ontologically as well as in its pedagogical role in PBE. It also attempts to interpret the other chapters of the book in light of the philosophical implications.

AB  - Virtual reality has been proposed as a promising technology for higher education since the combination of immersive and interactive features enables experiential learning. However, previous studies did not distinguish between the different learning modes of the four-stage experiential learning cycle (i.e., concrete experience, reflective observation, abstract conceptualization, and active experimentation). With our study, we contribute a deeper understanding of how the unique opportunities of virtual reality can afford each of the four experiential learning modes. We conducted three design thinking workshops with interdisciplinary teams of students and lecturers. These workshops resulted in three low-fidelity virtual reality prototypes which were evaluated and refined in three student focus groups. Based on these results, we identify design elements for virtual reality applications that afford an holistic experiential learning process in higher education. We discuss the implications of our results for the selection, design, and use of educational virtual reality applications.

AB  - Architecture practice is reshaped by new technological developments such as virtual reality, augmented reality, 3D printing, computational design, robotics, etc. Future architects are expected to deliver spatial solutions, to understand changing living conditions and to discover the different future by responsing technological improvements. In architecture schools, students should explore and investigate design practice with different production methods, systems and materials by using various technologies in collaborations with interdisciplinary partners and industry. The study aims to understand the STEAM concept which is considered as a promising education approach and formulated; science, technology, engineering, math and then adds an 'A' for arts which represents the creative thinking and design approach. The STEAM concept and its place in the architectural education are discussed. The discipline of architecture is an intersection of technology, art and science. The architecture schools' curriculum reflects the interdisciplinary STEAM nature throughout the history. Virtual Reality (VR) is created through interdisciplinary technology and has the potential to prepare the students to future, to develop analytical and abstraction abilities.

AB  - With the rapid development of information technologies, virtual reality (VR) has caught much attention in education. However, scanty studies have been committed to a meta-analysis of its effect in education in terms of various components. This study, through a meta-analysis, systematically reviews the effect of VR technologies on educational outcomes in terms of various components. It concludes that VR technologies generally exert a strong and positive influence on educational outcomes despite some negative findings in their effect on anxiety, cognition, creativeness, gender differences, learning attitudes, learner satisfaction, and engagement. Future research could expand the research by including more publications and examine the effect of VR technologies on educational outcomes through interdisciplinary cooperation.

AB  - While many reports espouse the potential impact that 3-D virtual worlds are expected to have on teaching and learning in higher education in a few years, there are few empirical studies that inform instructional design and learning assessment in virtual worlds. This study explores the nature and process of learning in Second Life in a graduate interdisciplinary communication course in fall 2007. Literature suggests that 3-D virtual worlds can be well suited for experiential learning environments. In this study, the actual instructional effectiveness of Second Life as an experiential learning environment for interdisciplinary communication is empirically examined using mixed research methods of journal content analysis, surveys, focus group, and virtual world snapshots and video.

AB  - Open educational resources (OERs) are teaching, learning, and research resources that have been made available such that they can be used, shared, and modified freely. Motivated by recent OER development successes, an interdisciplinary team at a Sino-foreign Higher Education Institution in China, University of Nottingham Ningbo China (UNNC), have been engaged in the creation of a new virtual reality (VR) OER, initially aimed at students and educators in the institution's Civil Engineering department. The VR OER centres around the creation of a virtual field trip (VFT), capturing knowledge and experience not often available to students. This paper examines the background and motivations to the project, outlining the strategies and cooperation so far employed, and explores the progress and challenges encountered. Anticipated further challenges, and potential mitigation, as the project continues are also discussed.

AB  - This work-in-progress paper describes an interdisciplinary research project which relies on innovation in computer science to enhance pedagogy for second language learning and teaching. A design framework for adaptation was applied to a virtual reality teaching environment aimed at teaching prepositions to learners of English as a foreign/second language. The design was informed by Cognitive Learning Theory [1], [2], 13], Cognitive Linguistics [4]-[6], and Enaction Theory [7]; more precisely, the virtual reality teaching environment presents physical tasks specifically designed to teach the different senses of the preposition 'over' based on Tyler and Evan's theoretical framework [8]. The dynamic environment provides real-time data on the actions and progress of the students allowing for empirical analysis of the effects of changes on learning outcomes.

AB  - This chapter briefly explores the meaning of "virtual" and the psychological concepts of presence and immersion followed by the application of virtual reality (VR) methods in post-secondary education. A meta-analysis was conducted to determine the efficacy of VR compared to more traditional teaching methods. Overall, students who experienced VR significantly outperformed those experiencing more traditional methods by about three-quarters of a standard deviation. These results were moderated by immersiveness (students in moderately immersive environments outperformed those in low or high immersive environments), whether place-based pedagogies were incorporated (students experiencing place-based VR pedagogies performed better), and student level (undergraduate students in VR conditions performed better than those in traditional classes). It is concluded that VR pedagogical methods, particularly when moderately immersive and place-based, benefit undergraduate students the most.

AB  - Extended reality, a concept that encompasses virtual reality, augmented reality and mixed reality, has seen remarkable progress in recent years and has had a great impact on the understanding of education. Research on extended reality has provided benefits in improving teaching and learning, based on two key concepts: the degree of immersion and the sense of presence. However, these contributions need to be reviewed using a grounded critical methodology to avoid falling into a technophilia without scientific evidence. This article aims to establish and evaluate the contributions extended reality makes to education and the educational challenges it poses in light of the development of the metaverse. For this purpose, firstly, each type of reality is defined and its applications in the field of education are evaluated from a critical point of view. Secondly, a critical argument is posed about the advantages and disadvantages of these technologies in educational practice. Thirdly, the challenges posed by the metaverse in education are described. This analysis shows how extended reality has contributed to the development of innovation and improvements in the teaching and learning process, although a lack of training for teachers who design learning experiences based on extended reality and a lack of interdisciplinary collaboration between the fields of technology and pedagogy are apparent. These results influence the development of the metaverse, which is another step in the evolution of extended reality that will have a great impact in the field of education. Our findings suggest there is a need to design an ethical code, develop a culture and protect the identity of users.

AB  - Objectives: To explore and map the evidence for virtual reality and artificial intelligence in simulation for the provision of pain education for pre and post registration nurses.
   Design: A scoping review of published and unpublished research from 2009 to 2019.
   Data sources: Nine electronic databases and hand-searching of reference lists.
   Review methods: Studies were included if virtual reality or artificial intelligence interventions were used for education on pain care provision in nursing. Data were extracted and charted using an extraction tool and themes were explored using narrative analysis.
   Results: The review process resulted in the inclusion of four published studies. All studies used mixed methods and used artificial intelligence within clinical simulations as an intervention. No studies using virtual reality for pain education met the inclusion criteria. Participants of three studies were undergraduate nursing students in universities and participants in the fourth study were registered nurses within a hospital. Outcomes measured were user acceptance of the technology and feasibility in all studies. The context was hospital located and focused on acute pain episodes, with one exception being sickle cell pain. Three studies had adult patients and the other pediatric patients. The exclusion of input from a patient perspective was notable, as was a lack of interdisciplinary involvement.
   Conclusion: Nurses are integral to the assessment and management of pain in many care settings requiring comprehensive communication and clinical skills. There is a paucity of research on the use of virtual reality or artificial intelligence in pain education for nurses. Current studies are preliminary in nature and/or pilot studies. Further empirical research, with robust design is required to inform nursing education, practice, and policy, thereby supporting the advancement of nursing pain education.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Virtual reality simulators track all movements and forces of simulated instruments, generating enormous datasets which can be further analyzed with machine learning algorithms. These advancements may increase the understanding, assessment and training of psychomotor performance. Consequently, the application of machine learning techniques to evaluate performance on virtual reality simulators has led to an increase in the volume and complexity of publications which bridge the fields of computer science, medicine, and education. Although all disciplines stand to gain from research in this field, important differences in reporting exist, limiting interdisciplinary communication and knowledge transfer. Thus, our objective was to develop a checklist to provide a general framework when reporting or analyzing studies involving virtual reality surgical simulation and machine learning algorithms. By including a total score as well as clear subsections of the checklist, authors and reviewers can both easily assess the overall quality and specific deficiencies of a manuscript.
   DESIGN: The Machine Learning to Assess Surgical Expertise (MUSE) checklist was developed to help computer science, medicine, and education researchers ensure quality when producing and reviewing virtual reality manuscripts involving machine learning to assess surgical expertise.
   SETTING: This study was carried out at the McGill Neurosurgical Simulation and Artificial Intelligence Learning Centre.
   PARTICIPANTS: The authors applied the checklist to 12 articles using machine learning to assess surgical expertise in virtual reality simulation, obtained through a systematic literature review.
   RESULTS: Important differences in reporting were found between medical and computer science journals. The medical journals proved stronger in discussion quality and weaker in areas related to study design. The opposite trends were observed in computer science journals.
   CONCLUSIONS: This checklist will aid in narrowing the knowledge divide between computer science, medicine, and education: helping facilitate the burgeoning field of machine learning assisted surgical education.

AB  - This paper presents the digital museum as an effective tool for learning. Using the example of a digital museum created in February 2021, the authors use autoethnography to demonstrate how this virtual reality location served both hosts and visitors of an interdisciplinary seminar in higher education that took place during the first pandemic lockdown in the Netherlands. The creation, visitation, and reflective evaluation of the museum formed three phases of learning that benefitted curators and guests who represented various disciplines and levels within higher education. Though generated by the physical restrictions of pandemic education, this example underscores the didactic value of the digital museum as a post-pandemic educational medium.

AB  - Background: Contemporary healthcare systems are in dire need of teamwork and interprofessional collaboration, however, existing curricula of health education programs offer few opportunities to build these capabilities. Virtual simulations enable interaction and cooperative learning for students pursuing health majors. Objective: To explore the effectiveness of immersive virtual reality simulation (IVRS) in interprofessional education (IPE) and the experience of students from various disciplines in a virtual clinical environment. Design, data sources and methods: A scoping review was conducted. Literature was systematically searched from CINAHL, EMBASE, ERIC, MEDLINE/PubMed, ProQuest, PsycINFO, Scopus, Science Direct, Cochrane Library and Open Grey databases. Among 2352 records, 12 research articles were found and analyzed. Results: The experiences of students participating in IVRS centered on enhanced cooperation and communication across their disciplines. They obtained a more accurate picture of the patient and developed an interdisciplinary care plan. After the IPE session, they had greater appreciation of the importance of a team approach and shared learning. Students acknowledged the usability of virtual worlds (VWs) and appreciated the immersive learning experience that was offered. They gained valuable insight into mutual roles and believed that this experience would benefit their role as a health care team member. Conclusions: This study supports the usability of VWs for IPE. As a new teaching modality, the IVRS experience effectively promotes interprofessional collaboration and communication. Future advances in the use of these technologies are expected to revolutionize health science education.

AB  - While virtual reality (VR) is emerging as an interactive tool for chemical education, its application and assessment for chemical education are still limited. Thus, an educational VR activity based on interactive molecular dynamics in virtual reality (iMD-VR), which allows for realtime, immersive interactions with a dynamic molecular world, was now designed and executed to demonstrate chemical concepts and engage students in exploring molecular structures, motions, and interactions. There were 70 students in the first semester of an introductory organic chemistry course asked to complete an example task to pull a methane molecule through a carbon nanotube with iMD-VR software originally designed for research purposes by Glowacki and co-workers. Our assessments of this activity have shown valuable motivational impacts and measurable learning gains. The VR activity can be further tailored to many different levels by varying the topics and tasks, with affordable hardware and software.

AB  - Quantum computation based on quantum physics is spreading rapidly with many interdisciplinary studies from machine learning to genetics. After the unveiling of real quantum computers, this process has been rising almost exponentially. We are about to experience an effect with quantum computers similar to the effect created by the process from the first electromechanical computers to very large-scale integrated circuit computers. In the programming of quantum computers, we are in a similar place to programming classical computers at an early stage. There are various models in quantum computing, and the most widely used model is quantum gates. Therefore, an easy and practical understanding of the behavior of the gates used in the programming of quantum computers is of great importance. To realize this process, a virtual reality (VR)-based teaching platform of quantum computer programming called QU-VR Education Tool was designed by using Unity 3D VR. In the creation of this design, IBM's so-called Quantum Composer platform and Microsoft Quantum Katas were taken as a reference. In this study, the design process and usage of a novel VR-based platform are presented in detail.

AB  - As a teaching and learning medium, 360 degrees videos offer new teaching-learning experiences. Through the possibility of immersion, individual 360 degrees panoramic images, multi-perspective viewing options and interaction possibilities, they extend the advantages of conventional video technology. To understand the potential of using 360 degrees video technology for educational processes, a systematic literature review analyzed previous scientific articles (N = 44) about the interdisciplinary use of 360 degrees videos according to PRISMA guidelines. In the systematic literature selection, particular emphasis was placed on the conceptual distinction between virtual reality and 360 degrees videos. By the authors, 360 degrees videos are understood as a specific video format that has characteristics of virtual reality but is to be distinguished from virtual reality by the necessary real recording situation without programmed virtual environments. The results show a use of 360 degrees videos mainly for three teaching-learning purposes: presentation and observation of teaching-learning content, immersive and interactive theory-practice mediation, and external and self-reflection. Combined with the added value of conventional video technology and other immersive technology such as virtual reality, five added value categories for its use as a teaching-learning medium were identified: To increase learning motivation and interest, to learn in authentic and realistic learning scenarios, for immersive and interactive learning experiences, for multi-perspective observation opportunities and for individual learning. These consisted primarily of positive motivational effects for authentic or immersive learning experiences.

AB  - This research aims to explore the impact of STEAM on VR-based interdisciplinary courses and the course satisfaction of students from a sci-tech university. To achieve the goal, this study took students taking interdisciplinary courses at a scitech university in south Taiwan as the research subject and carried out an 18-week "STEAM course about the development of VR-based textbooks" through small-group cooperative learning. To investigate the impact of the STEAM course and the course satisfaction of students, this study adopted both quantitative analysis and qualitative analysis, such as questionnaire analysis and file analysis, to evaluate students' performances on the products and grades. This study creatively combined the interdisciplinary and convergent thinking of STEAM with the course about the development of VR-based textbooks. Based on the student-centered and teacher-facilitated concepts, this study designed the STEAM course about the development of VR-based textbooks and found that most students think highly of the impact of STEAM, course satisfaction, and the assistance of VR-based textbooks to STEAM. Lastly, this study proposed some practical advice on how to combine STEAM with VR-based course teaching.

AB  - Increased focus on out-of-school learning has led to extended use of Science Centers as learning arenas for junior and high school students in formal learning situations. The creation of learning trails, semantic collections of science center exhibits based on formal learning plans for interdisciplinary STEAM education, has become an area of focus. Previous design research has resulted in the definition of story-driven learning trails that foster flow and engagement in learners. In science centers, equal emphasis is placed on the physical real-world domain, represented by the exhibits themselves, as the virtual components, represented as collaborative positions-based portables carried between exhibits, linking the exhibits into virtual storylines using sensors and control assignments. This defines science center learning trails as mixed reality systems; holistic systems that integrate real and virtual elements, existing on the axis between real and virtual poles on the reality-virtuality continuum. Research has shown that a set of characteristics of narrative game-based learning has positive effects on engagement, motivation, and learning. The eLuna Framework comprises a co-design method and a visual language that emphasizes these characteristics, and that supports educators and game developers to co-specify blueprints of screen-based narrative learning game experiences. Applying thematic analysis and heuristic usability methods to interview data from two design studies completed by six science center educators based on a STEAM enabled exhibit cluster at the Bergen Science Centre VilVite, this research extends the eLuna Visual Language to distinguish between real and virtual elements for the eLuna Framework to achieve its full potential to co-design and co-specify science center mixed reality narrative game-based learning trails. The resulting extension can be plugged into the eLuna method and applied in future co-design and co-specification of mixed-reality narrative game-based learning trails which promote flow in learners, and affords positive effects on engagement, motivation, and learning.

AB  - We have used web-based three-dimensional (3D) technology as a way of attracting and engaging students in simple and complex formal and informal learning activities. The background for this kind of teaching approach has been interesting possibilities of stimulating independent learning and collaborative investigation about learning and using a 3D web-based platform for supporting k-12 education interdisciplinary curriculum development and influencing individuals' digital and visual literacy. It includes learning how to think better and a continuous reflection about contributing for solving problems such as low level of students' literacy, math and technology skills. The empirical work has showed that by hands on computer programming through a high level web-based language such as virtual reality modeling language (VRML), is possible improving individuals' technical skills; stimulating digital content production; increasing ones' literacy and math abilities; as well as supporting students' active comprehension of scientific principles related to diverse sciences that are part of school curriculum.

AB  - The virtuality continuum is a phenomenon that has theoretical approaches and practical applications in various domains. The simulation, interactivity or immersion in virtual worlds can define new approaches in information and communication technologies. The relationship with an environment changes when technological interfaces, videogames or augmented reality technologies are used. Our study focuses on an approach based on the creative processes and explores the different possibilities of the digital interactive environments. Quantitative and qualitative methodological approaches are used to describe how virtuality continuum related technologies transform the relationships between individuals and their environments, focusing on interdisciplinary STEAM domains. Inductive methodologies are also used to describe the interactive dynamics in projects using virtual or augmented reality. Results show how virtuality continuum related technologies can transform environments and interaction processes by integrating several factors: creative processes, emergent non-lineal narrative dimension displays, and implementation in established and emergent fields of research.

AB  - Current challenges and issues are so complex that without a close, interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary cooperation it is very difficult or even impossible to solve and find innovative approaches to them. We are living in the era of big data, artificial intelligence and also virtual reality which are changing the paradigm of all our living including education. As far as communication within multidisciplinary and multinational working teams is concerned, English has become a preferable language that is used worldwide including academia and research. In non-English speaking countries Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) have faced very similar challenge how to foster establishing English Education Environment (EEE). Most of their students speak different language and their level of English competence differs. Likewise, disciplinary teachers' (DTs') English competence and readiness to teach their courses in English vary. This contribution describes the project (Visegrad+) of HEIs from Slovakia, Hungary, Poland, Albania and Serbia, intended to study if Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL) and close cooperation between ESP/CLIL experts and DTs can result in effective English learning-teaching environment. The main project outcome - web platform for ESP/ CLIL and DTs communities is presented. Finally, as far as interdisciplinary teacher cooperation is concerned, some observations during COVID19 pandemic are illustrated.

AB  - In past decades the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages: Learning, Teaching, and Assessment (CEFR), is widely adopted and accepted as a European standard for teaching and learning foreign languages. CEFR's implementation promotes the linguistic diversity within the European Union and additionally support the use of Information and Communication Technologies as networks and digital tools at the service of teaching or learning foreign languages. In this broader context, the use of New Technologies has become today a key factor. The expansion of Virtual Reality's applications over the past years, meet the new advances of mobile devices (smartphones, tablets) and in mobile technologies that merge the real world with digital information leading to Augmented Reality applications.
   On the one hand, some of the Virtual reality (VR) applications such as Virtual Worlds can be an interesting tool for the cooperative teaching and learning of a foreign language and culture and can facilitate the acquisition of the target language, while also promoting interdisciplinarity through their multi-potential dimension. On the other hand, much of the current Augmented Reality (AR) applications, can also promote foreign language teaching and learning, although are mainly developed for marketing and commerce purposes. Especially in the educational area, this new technology is still searching for its important role.
   In the above context, the present study describes two recently conducted courses to a higher education class related to the use of some VR or AR current tools and apps. The postgraduate students were asked to propose communicative language activities, based on CEFR's communicative language competences, using some of these tools and then comment and discuss their results. The results showed that some uses of VR or AR, therefore mixed reality's implementations are suitable for foreign language education and can further promote interdisciplinary approaches on foreign language learning and culture.
   This work highlights the importance of both Virtual reality and Augmented Reality tools, their potential contribution to foreign language education and explores some of their perspectives. Furthermore, it discusses some empirical approaches and techniques that we have followed in these courses.
   The two conducted courses that were carried out has shown that there is an important dynamic in these fields but there is also a lack of communicative language learning activities that can be used with the use of these technologies.
   We suggest that by educating students on VR and AR technologies they will be able, as future language teachers, to think creatively about communicative language learning activities that can be used with these, to enhance the language learning and performance of their students and increasing their interest and motivation.

AB  - The promotion of the cultural and historical heritage through information technology is an extremely efficient formula for the proper use of technology in the process of perception and study of human cultural heritage. The opportunities offered by modern technologies allow a more attractive and correct way to enrich the access options to the elements of cultural-historical heritage. Training in the field of cultural-historical heritage is a complex and multidimensional process which requires different interdisciplinary approaches in order to achieve a thorough understanding of existing knowledge, on the one hand, and to create an understanding for revealing, researching, preserving and promoting of new discoveries, on the other. Nowadays, the training for specialists in the scope of cultural and historical heritage offers a lot of opportunities so to include the mixed reality in the educational process. The creation of virtual reconstructions through 3D models enriches the educational environment and improves the way information is conveyed. Preservation of cultural-heritage is a systematic process of search, study, identification, documentation, registration, conservation, restoration and socialization. Hence, protection of cultural heritage presents a system of measures ensuring its preservation in the Interest of Society. Particularly important is the question of the socialization of cultural heritage. Traditionally, it is related to the adaptation of cultural values and to the development of a program for its preservation, restoration and social engagement. The goal is to become more available to both scientists and specialists, as well as to anyone interested in their value. New digital services change our lives at a rapid pace and education is undoubtedly one of the most affected areas in this process. With the introduction of mobile educational applications as well as new technologies such as virtual reality and "expanded reality", a new training policy is being developed at the University of Library and Information Technology. There is a symbiosis between traditional ways of teaching and integrating new technologies as a virtual reality in the educational process. In this paper we briefly debate the power of visual discernment in human education and encounter, and how we can control visual intelligence to advance understanding in science. Approaches will be presented how to create complex virtual models of cultural heritage from humanitarian students. Good policies and practices will be shown by the University of Library Studies and Information Technologies to integrate the mixed reality into our students' education. Another aspect of this work is to present the use of new 3D technologies in the training of students and PhD students as a virtual reality. It will be shown how to create virtual halls in which students will be able to distance themselves from lectures and "touch" the ancient cities. This virtual world enables people to take activities that include virtual meetings, training sessions, and virtual school or university training.

AB  - Despite high prevalence rates of elder abuse and neglect (EA/N), compliance with mandatory reporting remains low. A lack of practical training on EA/N has been identified as a barrier. This article describes the development, implementation, and evaluation of an innovative virtual-reality-based educational intervention intended to improve EA/N recognition and reporting among nurses and social workers providing in-home services. The educational intervention consisted of two parts, including an introductory course and advanced assessment training in virtual reality. The advanced assessment training was focused on learning to use the QualCare Scale, an instrument used to assess quality of family caregiving. Data was evaluated in terms of user satisfaction, changes in knowledge, and changes in practice. Results indicate that participants were satisfied with the content and format of the training program. Participants made gains in knowledge in identification and had 99% accuracy in their mandatory reporting decisions. Importantly, professionals reported making changes in their daily practice based on knowledge and skills learnt. Evaluation data indicate that this interdisciplinary training program was a satisfactory way to learn that produced changes in knowledge and impacted clinical practice. Few implementation barriers were encountered during this project suggesting it would be replicable.

AB  - This study focuses on an educational game titled Cellverse, a two-player cross-platform VR project intended to teach high school biology students about cell structure and function. In Cellverse, players work in pairs to explore a human lung cell and diagnose and treat a dangerous genetic disorder. Cellverse is being designed by the Collaborative Learning Environments in Virtual Reality (CLEVR) team, an interdisciplinary team consisting of game designers, educational researchers, and graduate and undergraduate students. Using a design-based research approach, we have enlisted the help of both subject matter experts and user testers to iteratively design and improve Cellverse. The objective of this paper is to share how user and expert feedback can inform and enhance the development of learning games. We describe how we gather and synthesize information to review and revise our game from in-game observations, semi-structured interviews, and video data. We discuss the input of subject matter experts, present feedback from our user testers, and describe how input from both parties influenced the design of Cellverse. Our results suggest that including feedback from both experts and users has provided information that can clarify gameplay, instruction, subject portrayal, narrative, and in-game goals.

AB  - Recently, the new-generation-of-game-assisted practicums have been widely utilized in college language education to reduce the teacher-student psychological distance and promote teacher immediacy. In tandem with the attempt for elevating the ubiquity of teachers' tutelage, extensive instantiation of healthcare fields through the multiplayer scenes of augmented reality games has made arrangements for student engagement and helped ease the comprehension of English for Medical Purposes. Accordingly, in an English for Medical Purposes course, this interventional study, using a parallel design, endeavored to explore the dependency of applicability of the tutored augmented reality-game-assisted flipped classrooms on teacher immediacy among 240 Asian medical undergraduates. The participants' perception of the course was debriefed as well. In so doing, augmented reality games were practiced in the circles of two randomly assigned sets convened in the practicums of the flipped English for Medical Purposes comprehension classrooms under the teachers' tutelage. The formative assessments of students' comprehension in the online teaching sessions and in the fields in the quantitative phase were followed by a focus-group interview in the qualitative phase. The findings revealed that the English teachers' immediacy fostered the students' engagement and added to the applicability of the tutored augmented reality game-assisted flipped classrooms for English for Medical Purposes comprehension skills education. It was also found that students perceived their reduced psychological distance with the English teachers in favor of enlisting supports from their peers in doing English for Medical Purposes comprehension through the tutored augmented reality game-assisted flipped classrooms. The findings could provide a basis for teachers who are interested in fostering immediacy with students in the new-generation-of-game-assisted practicums for college language education.

AB  - Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) are part of a digital technology known as human interface technology (HIT). These technologies are emerging, as AR is part of the reality-virtuality continuum of placing virtual objects in the real world, in real time. This technology is currently being developed for use in a many industries internationally, and its use to enhance and reinforce procedural learning in medicine and radiology is well established. Similarly, within the global context, there is a wealth of information about the benefits of using simulators, such as manikins in health care, as effective and safe learning and teaching (L&T) tools. The use of immersive VR within education has been found to accelerate student understanding of complex concepts. By integrating simulation and AR, authentic and exciting interdisciplinary L&T opportunities can be explored.
   The majority of current nursing, medical and human life science students are 'digital natives' and have expectations that their L&T experiences will be supported by the digital world with which they are familiar. However, its use for 'immigrants' is also being well received. Rigorous research exploring the use of AR in the simulation environment for L&T is currently scant. The School of Nursing and Midwifery at the University of Tasmania, Australia, in collaboration with the HITLAB Australia, is leading L&T simulation in Tasmania by developing innovative ways of using AR in order to reduce the theory-practice gap and stimulate new ways of learning in a low risk health environment.
   The aim of this paper is to outline how HIT prepares to meet the expectations of 'millennial' students and healthcare professionals by integrating AR into the simulation skills environment.

AB  - I dedicated myself to the explicative phenomenon, its multiple aspects and dimensions forcing me to a prolonged interdisciplinary study, synthesized in my doctoral thesis. I deepened the problem of the instrumental support for valuable didactic rituals in some Canadian instructional design projects. Enriched by these experiences, and provoked by the conference's title, I want to signal the drawbacks and risks of "technologising" education. The propagandistic invocation of "modernization" or "efficiency" can cover other goals: creation of a perpetual educational market for reproducible, low-quality solutions. Some circular justifications may also arise (signalling degenerations). From polemics fed by antagonistic convictions (progressive versus conservatory views) to consensuses based on 'Paradigms" - the "technology versus education" debate reveals the absence of an integrative science.

AB  - The effective use of emerging technologies demands the training of highly qualified personnel with digital literacy professional skills. The aim of the study is to characterize the virtual construction site as a digital resource for pedagogical management of the educational process in the construction university. The principles of tradition and innovation have become the methodological basis for linking best practices in pedagogical management of the learning process with qualitative changes based on modern digital technologies. A virtual construction site entails a digital resource imitating professional activities and providing integration of science, technology, pedagogical management of educational process on the basis of common standards of data description. The content of the virtual construction site represents a complex multi-level menu corresponding to the construction stages. Efficiency criteria (metaproject, activity, digital, relevant, complex) allow to find out the level of formation of ability to work with digital technologies. The principles of selection and structuring of content ensure its validity and updating. The practical significance of the research is provided by the didactic functions of the virtual construction site, providing for the involvement of students in design and construction activities, establishment of interdisciplinary relations. The social significance consists in personalisation of the educational process and formation of the students' professional individuality.
   The originality of the study lies in the justification of the digital paradigm of higher education, which forms a pedagogical community that promotes and actively integrates digital content into the educational process.

AB  - Escola da Terra in the state of Goias started its activities in 2018. In two editions, it served 320 educators in the field. Based on the scope that Escola da Terra has reached in the state, with this work we seek to reflect on how the themes of interdisciplinarity, curriculum and gender allow a more coherent perception of the teaching process in the school of our time. We seek the theoretical framework of discourse and its meaning, within the analysis of French discourse, which has Michel Foucault as a reference. As a methodological resource, we adopted semi-structured questions, using the virtual space as a means of accessing the speeches of the participating teachers. From the speeches of the research subjects, we understand that the debate and continuing education have made it possible to break with the biological and naturalized view of gender, helping the understanding of sexuality. Furthermore, thinking about the curriculum and the importance of differences in the classroom is possible through collaborative work that requires challenge, negotiation, and flexibility to build an interdisciplinary proposal contextualized with the reality of the field and its subjects.

AB  - "The student of the future will be an Explorer" says Marshall McLuhan. At its earliest age, school education should have as a primary goal the awareness of learning through research, through discovery and through interdisciplinary activities. The study area of Mathematics is developing towards all these modern purposes. Carl Friedrich Gauss known as the prince of Mathematics, defines the domain as the "Queen of the sciences". He is right. Certain scientific areas such as Theoretical Physics are, in reality, mathematical sciences with axioms that correspond to reality. Researcher in Theoretical Physics, J. M Jordan, suggests that physical sciences should be considered public knowledge and that Mathematics should be a part of it. The latter shares many similarities with physical sciences from which we mention the usage of hypothesis' logical study. Apart from this, intuition and experiments also play important roles while formulating hypotheses in both mathematics and other sciences. Experimental Mathematics continues to gain an increasing importance among hard sciences due to computerising and simulation. This article aims to be the continuation of the article "Visual solutions for learning in the virtual environment" offering an understanding beyond the written world of mathematical formulas. It is a pleasurable experience of freely experimenting that makes students forget about the boring teaching methods. The article depicts an interactive experience in the virtual environment of educational software.

AB  - Conferences have been a staple part of promoting academia since its early days. Traditionally these conferences are held in a single geographical location, which adds tremendous logistical and financial burdens to the organizers, sponsors, and the attendees. Virtual conferences have been used in the past to address some of these concerns. However, they fail to bring in the immersive experience of the live event leading to a lack of engagement, disinterest, and ineffectiveness in furthering academic progress.
   This paper describes the use of immersive media-based tools to support professional education in the form of a virtual conference. We present one case study using this methodology in the 2019 Digital International Creative Arts Therapies Symposium (DICATS): A 24-hour, live, global, multi-site, interactive virtual conference. The symposium comprised of live streaming to a global audience from seven host sites: Singapore, Moscow, London, Philadelphia, Colorado, Los Angeles, and Vancouver. Each host site offered experiential activities for local audiences from contributors, including digital innovators, researchers, and practitioners in the fields of arts and arts therapies, eHealth, game design for health, and digital technology for social justice. The symposium content combined live content (traditional slide-deck presentations, interactive group activities, and collaborative artmaking), pre-recorded presentations, and interactions between sites using social media, and instant messaging.
   This framework has proven to be effective in expanding existing arts therapies' education and therapy practices, showcasing innovative work, and promoting interdisciplinary collaborations and conversations across the globe. A recording of this unique 24-hour event is available so all participants can access the complete symposium. With the increasing availability of low-cost VR gear and high-speed internet, we believe that this framework for a virtual conference will be useful and efficient in supporting professional education.

AB  - This article aims to analyze the potential of new technologies in the area of green chemistry didactics. When viewed through the lens of systems thinking, the use of these ubiquitous tools can be a driving force for the development of a sustainable world because of their global use and reach. The authors concentrate on flat e-learning platforms, social media tools, virtual reality platforms, and machinima, as these tools enable learners to participate in different interdisciplinary topics and exercise habits that trigger behavioral changes through learning by doing or learning from mistakes. To demonstrate the potential of innovative didactic tools, examples of mini scenarios for the development of chemistry lessons are provided, and these scenarios promote the sustainability concept and systems thinking. The authors conclude that the pursuit of sustainability goals in chemistry education should involve extended thinking about instructional design and asymmetries in technology use, as well as incorporate green teaching into the principles of green chemistry.

AB  - Background Individuals with advanced Parkinson's Disease (PD) and Parkinson-related disorders (PRD) are frequently referred for home allied therapies and nursing care, yet home healthcare professionals have limited training in PD/PRD. While recognizing the need for such care, patients and families report home healthcare professionals are unfamiliar with these conditions, which may be driven by neurophobia and may contribute to suboptimal care and early termination of services. We sought to determine the feasibility and effects of a virtual, multimodal educational intervention on PD knowledge, confidence, and empathy among home health professionals. Methods Home health nurses, occupational therapists, physical therapists and physical therapy assistants, and speech-language pathologists participated in a daylong, virtual symposium on advanced PD/PRD, combining focused lectures, discipline-specific breakout sessions, immersive virtual reality vignettes, and interactive panels with both patients and families, and movement disorders and home healthcare experts. Participants completed online pre- and post-symposium surveys including: demographics; PD/PRD knowledge (0-10 points possible); empathy (Interpersonal Reactivity Index); and 10-point scales of confidence with and attitudes towards individuals with PD/PRD, respectively. Pre-post intervention changes and effect sizes were evaluated with paired t-tests and Cohen's d. We performed qualitative analyses of post-symposium free-text feedback using a grounded theory approach to identify participants' intentions to change their practice. Results Participants had a mean improvement of 3.1 points on the PD/PRD knowledge test (p < 0.001, d = 1.97), and improvement in confidence managing individuals with PD/PRD (p = 0.0003, d = .36), and no change in empathy. The interactive, virtual format was rated as effective by 95%. Common themes regarding symposium-motivated practice change included: interdisciplinary collaboration; greater involvement and weighting of the patient and caregiver voice in care plans; attention to visit scheduling in relation to patient function; recognition and practical management of the causes of sudden change in PD/PRD, including infections and orthostatic hypotension. Conclusions A virtual, multimodal, brief educational pilot intervention improved PD/PRD-specific knowledge and confidence among home healthcare nurses and allied health professionals. Future studies are necessary to test the short- and long-term effects of this intervention more broadly and to investigate the impact of this education on patient and caregiver outcomes.

AB  - Stereopsis is the most advanced stage of vision. This characteristic of our visual system and its applications is particularly interesting for optics and optometry students and professors. It is also significant for other disciplines, including history of art, history, fine arts, and architecture, where stereophotos and anaglyphs provide an effective, easy-to-use tool for enabling depth perception of historical-artistic heritage (monuments, architecture, sculptures, etc.). Stereoscopic vision has also led to attractive applications for the general public in the field of entertainment (3D cinema, virtual reality, etc.). However, people's knowledge about how our stereoscopic vision works, or how a stereo photo is made, is limited.
   To improve the teaching and learning process about these issues in formal education, we developed an innovative interdisciplinary teaching project, carried out over four academic years, which connected stereophotography and stereoscopic vision with the historical-artistic heritage of Granada, Spain. The participants included professors and undergraduate students from the degrees in optics and optometry, fine arts, history, history of art, architecture, and law at the University of Granada. They studied various monuments and visited these, sharing their knowledge, working collaboratively and writing reports, as well as making stereophotos, stereoscopes and 3D glasses.
   We also provided scientific and cultural outreach through a publication (involving interdisciplinary knowledge and anaglyphs of Granada), and carried out several conferences and exhibitions, some of which were part of the International Day of Light in Spain, such as the exhibitions "GRANAglyphs" (Parque de las Ciencias Science Museum, Granada) and "Anaglifos galdurienses" (Jodar, Spain).

AB  - Promoting cultural and historical heritage through information technologies (IT) is an extremely working formula for the proper use of technologies in the process of perception and study of human cultural heritage. The opportunities offered by the modern technologies allow more attractive, adequate and correct way to enrich the options for accessing elements of the cultural and historical heritage (CHH).
   Cultural and historical heritage education is a complex and multidirectional process that requires interdisciplinary approaches, in order to achieve deeper knowing of the existing knowledge and at the same time create a capacity to research, preserve and promote new discoveries. Today, the training of these professionals is opening up more possibilities for the application of mixed reality. The creation of virtual reconstructions, through 3D models, enriches the forms for providing a learning environment and improves the ways to providing information and new knowledge.
   This paper provides a brief retrospective of the R&D project "Mixed Reality Application in Learning and Promoting Cultural and Historical Heritage in a University Information Environment". The results of the survey of young people' attitude studying CHH to the application of new 3D technologies and their introduction into education are presented. The results of the analysis of the obtained data among students studying computer science are presented regarding the sufficiency of their hours for studying 3D technologies and their desires to continue their career development in this field.
   The results presented confirm our initial hypothesis that young people are open to the new 3D technologies. They want to touch this unfamiliar world. Students are eager to get involved in such research projects. They want new technologies to become an invariable part of their courses.
   As a natural part of this paper, we will also demonstrate some of the scientific and practical results of the project the creation of complex 3D objects related to CHH through open source software.

AB  - Augmented Reality (AR) is the enrichment of the objects and spaces in the physical world through the use of computer generated artificial, virtual and synthetic 3D elements. Different from virtual reality, AR does not replace the actual world, but rather it enriches the actual world environment with 3D digital elements. AR can be used in many different fields, such as military research, the games industry, medicine, and engineering, and is becoming increasingly widespread as an innovative technology and an interdisciplinary field. In particular, the fact that mobile devices such as smartphones and tablet computers have more powerful processors, higher resolution screens and more highly-developed cameras, and are empowered with features such as GPS, digital compasses and accelerometers, has contributed to AR becoming ever more widespread. There are several reports (Horizon Reports, Abi Research, Juniper Research Reports) regarding the current and future status of AR that include some anticipation. The common point of all the reports is the fact that AR will become more widespread and effective in the future. Although this study contains the trends in the fields such as engineering, game sector and marketing its focal points are "educational environments" and "open and distance learning". Particular focus will be on AR usage within the context of educational technologies and making forecasts for the future. The study will be supported with infographics, tables and visuals and a detailed analysis will be made. In the relevant literature no similar comprehensive literature analysis has been encountered. This study is expected to fill this gap in the literature. In this study, an implication is aimed to be made through analyzing all trend reports about AR in the literature, articles, and other academic publications through conducting an in-depth literature review and content analysis methods. As a result, a contribution to the literature will be made through a comprehensive study that includes predictions about the current and future status of AR.

AB  - hapTEL, an interdisciplinary project funded by two UK research councils from 2007 to 2011, involves a large interdisciplinary team (with undergraduate and post-graduate student participants) which has been developing and evaluating a virtual learning system within an HE healthcare education setting, working on three overlapping strands. Strand 1 involves the technical development and evaluation of the hapTEL workstation which simulates clinical conditions for dental training including haptics (sense of touch). Strand 2 involves examining the traditional undergraduate curriculum and how this could benefit from the use of haptics. Strand 3 is concerned with the educational evaluation of the impact of the work carried out within Strands 1 and 2. Two theoretical frameworks (Entwistle, (1987) and Webb and Cox (2004)) have been used to identify as many factors as possible which could affect the impact of Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL) on the quality of the learning achieved. These frameworks have formed a foundation for measuring the impact of TEL on curriculum change, teachers' pedagogical practices, students' learning and on institutional practices. A range of quantitative and qualitative methods were designed, piloted and evaluated in order to measure the impact of TEL on teaching and learning; and to have a rich and robust data set which also addresses the variables in the frameworks. The results from using these frameworks show that institutional and departmental factors should be considered when evaluating the impact of TEL in higher education and that these had a major influence on the design and curriculum integration of the hapTEL systems. We have also shown that by involving the end users from the beginning enabled not only an enhancement of the students' learning experiences but also a modification to the traditional curriculum itself and the successful integration of TEL within a very traditional undergraduate higher education dental curriculum. The conclusions from this paper confirm earlier reviews of researching TEL that technology integration is extremely complex and the related research requires a comprehensive approach of both quantitative and qualitative methods if one is to take account of the range of variables identified by theoretical frameworks. Finally, repeating the range of empirical investigations for a second year enables researchers to validate the effectiveness of the methods used in the initial year and thereby maximise the reliability and generalisability of the research outcomes.

AB  - In order to meet future challenges, universities will have to take an active role getting involved in providing complex and diverse education, in a world where man is increasingly individualized.
   The personalization of education is the consequence of the need for individuality of modern man who no longer learns to occupy a place dictated by others but to freely and dynamically define his own roles. Hence the universities must have the mission to personalize the forms of education thus recognizing the individual's right to be unique, to choose how he wants to be and what he wants to study in order to define himself and to get integrated into society.
   The "Ovidius" University of Constanta is one of the accredited and recognized higher education institutions that addresses educational activities (theoretical and practical) for the training of future specialists through interdisciplinary study programmes and at the same time paying attention to the scientific research involving students in bachelor and master study cycles.
   It is increasingly difficult for any educational institution in the current economic context to equip new laboratories with appropriate technical facilities intended for applied educational process purposes, particularly where equipments, devices, measuring and control gauges or experiment stands are unreasonably expensive. This happens, especially within technical faculties, where relatively small number of students makes justification and capitalization of investment particularly difficult.
   Each team of teachers working in such education institutions is permanently looking for solutions offering the opportunity to illustrate processes, phenomena, technologies, experiments or other activities that help students understand correctly the issues presented. The Naval Engineering Port and Energy Department within the Mechanical, Industrial and Maritime Engineering of "Ovidius" University of Constanta offers its naval architecture students, as alternative, a virtual laboratory that exemplifies the ship manufacturing cycle.
   What does this mean? Use of specialized software applications, three-dimensional virtual modelling, interactivity and animation, accessing databases used in ship construction. The project is in its initiation phase and is implemented through the involvement of specialized teachers and students. Several models of ship structures have been executed and the user can install, by means of specific devices, any structural element on any position or can move through the structural elements of the vessel and even has the ability to execute virtual welding seams, cuts, machining works or any other operations characteristic to the ship construction technological flow.
   The idea of using virtual reality as an education instrument in the field of naval architecture started from the experience offered by the internships in naval shipyards which highlighted a series of issues such as: disturbance caused by the presence of students on the technological platforms of shipyards; risk of accidents for students; inability to see a complete manufacturing process given the very short span of the practical training period of students.

AB  - Disease education is a fundamental component in health science and medicine curricula, as it prepares students for their progression into health profession careers. However, this requires an ability to integrate concepts across multiple disciplines. Technology-enhanced interventions may bridge this gap, and this study assessed the effectiveness of a textbook-style or a three-dimensional mixed reality (MR, a hybrid of augmented and virtual reality) HoloLens resource for student learning and knowledge retention using asthma as a model of disease. Sixty-seven first-year undergraduate health science and medical students were randomized into two groups to complete a lesson on the physiology, anatomy, pathology, and pharmacology of asthma, delivered through either a textbook-style (n = 34) or MR (n = 33) resource. Participants took part in the study in small groups and completed the intervention and surveys in separate areas of a large laboratory space. A pre-test prior to the lesson included multiple-choice questions, with the post-test having additional multiple-choice questions to assess learning. A follow-up test to assess retention was performed two weeks later. Pre- and post-test scores revealed increased learning across both the textbook (p = 0.001) and MR (p = 0.05) interventions, although higher test results were obtained by those using the textbook-style resource (p < 0.05). There was no difference between groups in knowledge retention scores. Although the textbook-style resource was more effective for increasing test results, participants perceived MR as more favorable, highlighting the experience as enjoyable and useful. This study presents MR as an option for integration in cases where educators wish to enhance student enjoyment of the learning experience. However, the results suggest that traditional text-based resources persist as a fundamental delivery mode within a modern curriculum.

AB  - In the last few years, information and multimedia technologies have developed to an extent that allows new ways of storing, preserving, displaying and dissemination of information related to cultural and historical heritage. This paper presents part of the activities and results on research project Models of Socialization of Cultural Heritage in a 'Smart City' DN05/3, 14.12.2016, supported by the National Science Fund at the Bulgarian Ministry of Education and Science.
   The need for developing such a project has been defined by the fact that in our country cultural heritage has been raised to a high priority level in important strategic documents even though there is a lack of a conceptual model at a national level on integrating scientific, educational and cultural policies and the application of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in the field of cultural heritage. We think that creating such a model will be very useful for the process of heritage socialization. So far, the greater part of the scientific research in this field, have mostly been oriented towards technological issues of cultural heritage digitalization and yet there is not enough interdisciplinary research related to new models of cultural heritage socialization.
   The working hypothesis is based on the opportunities offered by the "Smart City" for the development of virtual reality as a modern approach that can be included in education in the field of cultural heritage and heritage socialization. Within the current paper two aspects have been emphasized: the integration of information technologies in education in the sphere of cultural heritage and the digital presentation of museum displays. Descriptive qualitative method was employed in this study. The data were obtained through direct observations of museum institutions in Bulgaria in terms of the degree of online access to museum expositions, the degree of digitization of museum collections and the degree of digital representation of museum expositions. Some of the basic problems of museums in Bulgaria have been systematized. We have also used combined methods of analysis and synthesis. Survey results have been reported on good practices in creating interactivity in modern museum displays. The innovative product - a system of hologram virtual reality (HVR) has been presented. This product is now used in the teaching process of students in the field of cultural heritage and the real application of ICT.
   The achieved results have been applied in the process of learning in BA programs of the specialty Information Collections of Cultural and Historical Heritage. Results are used to improve the quality of education in the field of cultural heritage, to promote the exchange of scientific and practical experience among university tutors, museum specialists and experts. It is expected that the results find application in the programs for informing and training for raising the capacity of local communities in the sphere of cultural tourism.

KW  - Digital technologies; Communication, Brazilian Higher Education
AB  - The research on the use of digital technologies in countries peripheral to the universal centers of capital has received strong investments from national and international authors, who seek to respond to the frequent emergent demands of the inclusive society. With the intention of contributing to this effort, we seek to understand the impacts of the use of digital techniques in Brazilian higher education, assuming the hypothesis that this use helps the education of students who could not or would have more difficulties in attending university in the face-to-face modality, occurring, as a consequence, the significant increase of virtual courses offered in the distance learning modality. Two objectives drive this reflection: (i) verify the existing types of communication and digital technologies; (ii) describe the choice and validity of these types in the national academic reality. As a theoretical framework, the studies on digital communication and digital technologies by Levy (2010), Thompson (1998) and Coelho, Costa and Mattar (2018) are included. together with broader concepts on the meaning of networks in the communication and mass media society developed by Castelis (1999) and Simondon (2020). The application of technologies to higher education is based on the interpretations of Cambi (1999) and Azevedo (2020). The methodological mode is interdisciplinary, uniting concepts of communication and of Pedagogy as the necessary focus to understand the changes in educational practices in the Brazilian educational system. The results achieved confirm that the use of technological resources in education contributes significantly to the improvement of teaching/learning and the elevation of the national HDI (Human Development Indexes).

AB  - The problem of educating high-level professionals, ready to solve a number of unstructured professional problems, is one of the most important in contemporary education, especially in the case of higher education. By using multiple case studies the paper analyzes the main factors which define most important problems that occur in professional life of recent college and university graduates. As it has been figured out the main factor is that majority of problems are either already solved or their solution within narrow professional approach requires too costly measures. This means that in order to prepare students to solve professional problems efficiently contemporary higher education system has to develop systemic way of thinking for its graduates. Insuring of such result requires, as it is proven by multiple case studies, the following: 1) increase the number of multidisciplinary classes, both in terms of contents of the offered courses and in terms of classes' participants diversity; 2) provide understanding of anthropomorphic influence each of professional solutions makes within person's and/or company's environment; 3) insure that graduates are able to make prognosis both professional and societal results of suggested solutions; 4) develop a multi-angle vision of any professional problem which would cover professional, anthropomorphic and societal aspects. Implementation of such an approach supposes high diversity of offered courses, a variety of educational lines, multidisciplinary activities, hands-on problem solution which are provided in Kazan federal university by means of case studies, role play, simulations, virtual reality development, internships, project-based education.

AB  - It is suggested by many scholars that if the goal of engineering education is to produce engineers who can critically design and create, then providing students with early opportunities to engage in creative engineering design is important. While basic design is focused on the development of new products for the individual, working towards a more sustainable world demands greater attention to designing for and with communities. Improving design education and examining design-learning outcomes requires a kind of targeted approach that could match the best practices to personalize student learning. Design is complex and design includes balancing the needs of multiple stakeholders. However, there is a gap in the preparation of design education that will be needed in a challenging environment. This paper reviews the history of design thinking in the engineering curriculum. Design thinking education starts with an understanding of its importance with socioeconomic relevance. Through observation and empathy, mapping the designer uses the listening and learning tools for mapping users unarticulated needs, working in a team environment. The designer takes time to think carefully why a certain project is considered and details which aspects of machine learning application can be applied from functional to complete success for the end users. The availability of powerful virtual reality methodologies, have made it possible to consider the realistic needs and visualize scenarios and to explore the design alternatives with new ideas before full scale resource allocation on new ideas. Mid-to-advanced level courses with experimental assignments require that students apply through experimentation the principles and concepts learned in foundation courses. The basic design tools such as axiomatic thinking, theory of inventive problem solving, design iteration and simulation using hardware-in-the loop are discussed with case studies. Consideration of product sustainability with the thoughts of design for disassembly and disposal has emerged as a major part of design thinking. Senior engineering courses center on cross and interdisciplinary design and capstone experiences so that students experience fully guided practice of device design and problem solving, simulating what they are likely to experience in the world. This paper examines the critical issues of design thinking in a curriculum from observation, empathy mapping, validation of the idea, and improvement of idea by virtual reality and machine learning, optimization of the idea by tools such as axiomatic design, hardware in the loop simulation, and finally examining product sustainability causes.

AB  - Aviation is an interdisciplinary subject that has influenced human development over the last century. Learning about aviation exposes students to principles of flight, language, earth science, aeronautical engineering, flight training and airmanship. In K-12 education, educators have started to encourage children to learn science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) subjects via aviation-themed activities to develop future scientists and engineers. This study investigated upper primary students' motivations to learn STEM via engaging in flight simulation experiences. The sample consisted of 345 10- to 13-year-old Hong Kong students from 8 primary schools. A modified version of the 31-item Science Motivation Questionnaire II (SMQ II) with four subscales with a focus on aviation was used. The relationships between intrinsic motivation, extrinsic motivation, self-efficacy and peer support across gender and performance were examined. The data obtained were analysed using factor analysis and a regression model. According to our model, students are most strongly motivated by peer support, followed by intrinsic motivation, and they are least motivated by self-efficacy. As expected, our results indicate that a gender gap exists in aviation-themed STEM learning. These findings can help educators to better understand students' perceptions of aviation science and further develop related learning activities.

AB  - A virtual reality (VR) experience and an interactive 360 degree video game about the orientation and sterilization modules of a stainless steel bioreactor (30L) in an university-level biomanufacturing lab were developed using Adobe Illustrator, Autodesk Maya, Unity3D with Playmaker, and HTC Vive. Oculus Quest headset will be used for the VR experience. Instructional design of a hybrid course is underway to incorporate the VR experience and/or video games into existing curriculum. This design is intended to increase the effectiveness, flexibility, and availability of the spaced-out repeated practices for the students, aiming to improve the entire learning experience.
   Biomanufacturing is a type of manufacturing that utilizes biological systems to produce commercially important products (e.g., alcohol, biofuels, vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, industrial enzymes, etc.) for consumer usages and industrial applications. As an interdisciplinary field incorporating chemical engineering, biochemistry and microbiology, biomanufacturing plays imperative roles in a variety of fields, such as food, beverage, pharmaceutical and health. The biomanufacturing processes can be divided into upstream (the manufacture of the products) and downstream (the recovery and purification of the products) with the bioreactor or fermentor as the key equipment.
   Steam-in-place (SIP), using pure steam for in-situ sterilization of the equipment (e.g., bioreactor and connections) and medium, is critical of biomanufacturing to reduce the risk of product contamination. The SIP operation is very complicated for first-time users, especially for students from non-engineering backgrounds. In addition, limited equipment availability, complicated lab preparation, long cycle time, high cost, and so on make it impossible to offer pre-lab studying, extra practice or post-lab review opportunities for students. Therefore, teaching hands-on SIP operation in a university-level biomanufacturing lab face great challenges. But having an online video game or VR option will greatly aid the students.
   Interactive video games allow users to view and interact with the objects on computers and create unique interactive experiences. Virtual reality (VR) further allows a simulated physical interaction with the objects and immersion experience, thus has been used in public education and workforce training in many fields (e.g., manufacturing, food science, biopharmaceuticals, automotive, and logistics). Recent advancement in VR technology has opened up new possibilities to exploit these valuable tools to further efforts to deliver biomanufacturing workforce training and education, particularly the bioreactor orientation and SIP operation labs. Comparing to the video game, VR gives more immersive visual environment experiences that more closely to the "hands-on" experience in the real word.
   The objective of this study is to design a VR experience together with an interactive 360 degree video game about the Bioreactor Orientation and SIP Operation, incorporating it into the existing biomanufacturing labs to create a hybrid lab, thus to solve the challenges faced during the existing curriculum and enhance student learning experience.

AB  - Problematization Methodology is made of an active methodology that makes it possible to improve students' capacity regarding their role as agents of participation and social transformation in the perception of real problems and in the search for original and creative solutions. The threefold goal 90-90-90 came to the world facing the HIV epidemic, proposing that, among the people living with HIV, 90% have diagnosis, 90% receive antiretroviral treatment, and 90% will have viral suppression by 2020. The expectation is to expand the diagnosis; however, it is necessary to reflect on the possibility of permanent health education about the subject. Objective: The aim of this study is to have the opportunity of transforming the user's practice of the first deal with the Rapid Test for HIV reactive in the Primary Attendance through Distance Learning, applying the Problematization Methodology. This is one of the Active Methodologies where the co-relation theory-practice permeates the whole process, in a dynamic of students' action-reflection-action, having, as a result, a degree of transforming action into the reality observed by the students. Iribarry refers to solidarity and sharing knowledge and concern of professionals to contribute with their knowledge aimed at solving a problem. The course is designed as an interactive and educational optional module offered in the Family Health Specialization at UNA-SUS/UFCSPA. This paper is part of the Master Degree research from the Postgraduate Program in Health Teaching at UFCSPA, where an education module has been developed with UNA-SUS/UFCSPA team. It is available on: https://ares.unasus.gov.br/acervo/handle/ARES/3474. The teaching methodology used was the Problematization Methodology and its innovation has been its implementation in the context of virtual education in healthcare. PM has a social nature for transforming praxis. The module design with an alternative use of PM is shown as a result. PM has, as its grounds, an arc of action from the reality experienced by students, followed by their observation, besides a list of problem situations, the theorizing of contents to be addressed in handling the situation, the organization of possible solutions to such problem situations, and, finally, an action plan to interfere with the initial proposed reality, so that it could be modified. The implementation of the last stage consisted of drawing up a flowchart proposal based on the management of users with an initial positive result for HIV virus within the reality of their health units, preferably aligned with the work team in the initial management of those patients. The objective was to enable professionals to organize the decision-making planning in order to modify the care line conduct. The organization of cooperation among peers to perform a collective proposal has reduced the need for a leader. At this time, reality is transformed and the arc stages can be applied again to expand its improvement. The reality of the students' professional practice in the course could be presented in the forum, which has shown that, despite the practice of the rapid test, there has not been previous thought about the time of the diagnosis revelation when a result was reagent. Thus, PM may be an alternative to work issues that are part of students' reality and that have as a goal behavioral improvement, not only transposition of knowledge. This would, therefore, narrow down the network of interactions between subject and object, and between theory and practice.
   Pedagogy, Informatics and Health should be partners, and interdisciplinary organization projects can promote the organization of the work process.

AB  - Higher Education (HE) institutions, as centers of creation and dissemination of knowledge, are called to respond to contemporary challenges. In the 21st century knowledge society, which is increasingly globalized and dominated by an expansion of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs), new skills are cultivated. Students learn to approach knowledge in a more collaborative, creative and innovative way. To prepare students for the international job market, HE institutions should increasingly aim at developing students' practical and transferable skills such as digital competency, skills for effective communication, problem solving, teamwork and entrepreneurship. In parallel, it is important that they cultivate a sense of social responsibility and cultural awareness, as well as an ability to address ethical dilemmas. As a response to contemporary challenges and needs, new trends emerge in higher education. Course redesigns, more integrated and interdisciplinary curricula, growing numbers of online/blended courses and programs, more student-driven personalized learning, experimentation with new teaching and learning spaces, emphasis on active learning, introduction of virtual reality are some examples of such trends.
   Academics, students and HE administration play an important role in this changing learning environment. This study focuses on instructors' perceptions and practices of active learning in higher education. It addresses the following main questions: How do instructors practice active learning? How do instructors' active learning practices get affected by their perception of effective pedagogy, knowledge of active learning and their instructional goals? The study is based on the results of a survey addressed to academics from different disciplines and different countries. Aspects examined are: teaching pedagogy and goals, the role of the instructor, active learning methods used in different disciplines, collaborative learning, the importance of ICTs, assessment, and evaluation of active learning methods used. The results of this exploratory study will be used to identify factors that lead to effective active learning strategies and thus prepare academics for change.

It is focused on smart window innovative development, including ideation phase and user studies. Disciplines collaborating are Industrial Design, Multimedia Design, Architecture, Electronic Engineering and Chemical Engineering. This process is based on the design of a product capable of harmoniously integration to existing buildings or new architectural projects. Issues observed have been the design of a window under mechanical and usability point of view, including studies of users to know about what people understand as a smart window, observing appearance and operation according to various autonomy possibilities. Accordingly, collaboration of undergraduate and graduate students of Industrial and Multimedia Design has been essential to develop virtual prototyping, both in buildings and window proposals as relevant part of designed tools for interviews and focus group. Virtual reality software and digital technologies have been used, such as printing and 3D scanning for ideation processes, all operated by students specially trained for this experience.
   Architecture Doctoral students have been integrated to geographic definition and potential application processes of windows in higher radiation areas of buildings, to explore high performance integrating factors coming from spatial conditions, as well as those intrinsically related to window. Specialties of engineering have developed issues related to glass and electronic characterization, considered more technologically advanced matter, therefore, this development has been carried out by European technology centers. Disciplinary integration methodological processes are presented in different academic and investigative levels, schematically establishing involvement of proposed members in their skills, making synthesis that allows replicating experience, based on this integrated systemic model. Company/university collaboration occurs mainly in work with Kommerling brand window manufacturer specifying participation of three different actors: university, technology centers and business.
   Education experience based on industrial design process with previously defined stages and systematically structured roles is renewed at the end of the work based on experience gained. The incorporation of different disciplines and actors supposed enriching learning to different students becoming important challenge to those leading process, with managers in specific areas and continuing communication for coordinated development. Learning has been related to integrated methodological processes to be followed, as well as to those of communicational and empathy skills to be developed.

AB  - Graduates in Food Science and Technology (FST) are trained to develop their career in all areas related to food, including food industries, government institutions, public or private companies, as well as education. This paper presents an analysis of a teaching innovation project, with 25 students in their last year of FST, conducted during the academic period 2010-11. This activity followed a previous experience of the same multidisciplinary academic group, and included visits to several food and beverages industries located at different areas of Spain. Academics, students and professionals from different food industries have worked together to help our students to improve several competences and skills. The aim of this experience was to develop general and specific student skills recognized as essential elements of the professional activity of graduates in FST. They include acknowledgement of ethical and legal responsibilities of their professional practice; the assessment of the importance of FST in the industrial, economic, environmental and social scenario, and relationship to other sciences; the autonomous and continuous knowledge updating about new products, advances, methodologies and techniques in FST; the use of quality scientific information; the development of a critical capacity to adapt to new situations and contexts, the creativity and ability to apply knowledge to solve problems in the food sector; the ability to work together and with professionals from other disciplines as well as to transmit information, ideas, problems and solutions. Moreover, this experience aimed to strengthen cooperation between academics from different areas of expertise (food engineering, food safety, food science, food technology and nutrition), identifying synergies and improving coordination between the different courses included in the FST degree. The methodology used was different in each phase of the project, according to different modes of teaching and learning adapted to the European Higher Education Area. It is proposed a change in education system moving from the "team teaching" to "specific teaching" to meet specific needs, with the use of different tools, including personal and team search for information, interviews with industrial technical professionals, in-site observation of equipments and processes, oral presentations, and self-evaluation. The results of this educational innovation experience, including the technical specifications and the presentations of seminars by students, will be available to all FST students and academics in the Virtual Campus.

AB  - The communication shows the space graveyard as an educational tool for humanities classes, since it provides numerous attributes for the study of religion, art, death and history. The communication aims to suggest a methodology that encourages new teaching practices that meet the contemporary teenager that every day is more inserted in virtual reality and real distanced every day. We believe that the study of representations of Death in the graveyard art will contribute to the approximation of teenager with related issues its own finitude, in addition to providing the student and the teacher a space of exchange, identification and reflection on various themes and values that permeate our lives and that are of fundamental importance for the composition of adults who will compose the society of the future. The communication is based on theoretical studies of Zyigmunt Bauman and Edgar Morin. The research is being developed from the qualitative analysis and presentation of practical experience at school. Working with the dying and the graveyard in classroom enables the realization of interdisciplinary work, besides providing a reflection about teaching practice, acting in the formation of the identity of the student, the ability to create and share meaningful experiences in education space, in developing reaffirmation of values and cultures and beliefs, as well as the formation of a future centered consciousness in the human condition, not just market.

AB  - One of the roles of museums and art galleries is to educate about, and engage visitors with the artworks held within. Museums and galleries may provide historical, technical, biographical, and sociopolitical context to artworks: the most common format for this context comes in the traditional "tombstone" and text-based wall labels; specialized audio/video guides; or trained docents and staff. Often, these wall labels act as the only access point that visitors have to information about the exhibited objects or works. Text-based wall labels have space limitations, as well as an inability to provide access to audio, video, Web services, and other information that could lead to further engagement. In addition, issues regarding accessibility arise when relying on traditional text-based wall labels, as sight, height, and language are fixed.
   In the past few years, there has been a rise of the use of software applications that expand on the amount of information made available to visitors. Generally, applications for museums are proprietary for that museum and programmed specifically for each exhibition. As a result, whenever a new exhibition is installed, a new version of the software must be developed. In most of these cases, the museums are required to supply proprietary hardware for check-out at the visitor's center, or install electronic tokens, such as Bluetooth in the galleries. Developing custom applications for each exhibit, and supplying loaner hardware to visitors, can be both costly and inefficient. Moreover, the vast majority of museums, specifically small to medium sized as well as regional and community venues, do not have the resources to create these costly systems.
   An interdisciplinary team from Texas State University has developed a smartphone application, called Musing-an Augmented Reality application that allows the museum visitor to scan an artwork with a smartphone camera to gain additional information. Using image processing, the application recognizes the artwork and places graphical user interface facilities in the form of points of interest (POI) over the artwork displayed on-screen. These POI provide the visitor with any combination of historical, technical, biographical, and sociopolitical information in the form of text overlays, audio, video, and/or Web pages.
   Placing the points of interest over specific parts of the artwork, allows the museum professional to provide additional information on specific aspects or sections of the artwork. In addition, Musing allows users to select artworks to keep in a personal archive by "favoriting" the works so that they can take this information home with them to further study, use as a resource for scholarship, and share with others in a variety of ways.

AB  - Since the field of information technology (IT) is constantly and rapidly developing, the training of engineering personnel couldn't be behind this global digital transformation. The new digital reality focuses on the mandatory formation of competencies which are end-to-end technology-oriented: Big Data, machine learning and artificial intelligence, augmented and virtual reality, robotics, blockchain, Internet of Things, 5G technologies, quantum technologies and others. Considering the speed of the development of these technologies, concerns have arisen about the relevance of the content of educational programs of higher education, as well as the degree of flexibility of educational trajectories of engineering graduates. To ensure the relevance and flexibility, constant revision of training programs regarding the study and development of new paradigms and solutions is required.
   This paper calls into question how to meet the requirements of the labor market at the time of graduation, considering that the educational programs are compiled at the time of the beginning of education and in accordance with the established federal standards of higher education. The goal is to adjust the results of the educational program or even to introduce completely new results in accordance with the changes that have occurred in the industry at the time of the implementation of the program to ensure students form the most relevant and in-demand competencies.
   The article describes the approaches of the Institute of Computer Technologies and Information Security (ICTIS) of the Southern Federal University to the creation of flexible, interdisciplinary bachelor's and master's degree educational programs. The content of these programs directly corresponds to the current and promising demands of the labor market. The presented approaches to the customization of educational programs meet the needs of students in personal and professional development. These approaches contribute to the development of a student-centered learning system that is specific for each level of education. Project-based learning is a key tool for the formation of relevant professional competencies within bachelor's degree programs. The master's degree focuses on the formation of unique research competencies in the context of the current agenda. For this purpose, the ICTIS has opened special research programs that involve a grant system for undergraduates. What is also important is the inclusion of undergraduates in research groups led by postdocs of the Institute.
   The key principle uniting these approaches into a single system is the introduction of its own educational standards in engineering areas in the ICTIS. The standards of the ICTIS regulate the possibility for students to choose variable professional competencies after mastering the basic educational component. These competencies are formed annually based on the analysis of prospective labor market demands and can be included in the program even after the start of its implementation.
   The analysis on the results of the ICTIS educational standards implementation has shown the effectiveness of the concept of these standards in the field of computer technology and information security.
   The effectiveness of this concept of the educational standard allows gradually being implemented in other fields of knowledge.

AB  - The adoption of technology on the individual and organizational level may be a necessary condition, but it is not sufficient for the digital transformation, seen as the mobilizing challenge to do something new and different. Without a strategic vision, we take the risk of acquiring resources to do the same as before, essentially changing the format. This inability imprisons the school to inconsequential models, resources and strategies. Interdisciplinary, social and project-based learning that the most advanced technology provides can be adopted. Augmented and virtual reality, the internet of things, robots, artificial intelligence and digital assistants can bring innovation to teaching. But also mobiles, games, simulators and multimedia can inspire collaborative creativity. On the other hand, the pandemic, in terms of the adoption of technology, constitutes a kind of insurrection against the fatalism that it is not possible to restart the system, that is, rethink the school. This study aims at investigating the degree of acceptance, materialized in the use of technology, by teachers of primary and secondary education, in the context of the classroom. As a methodological support to this study, the model "Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology" (UTAUT)) was used and a questionnaire applied to teachers at our school, obtaining 90 responses. The analysis of the responses reveals that the expected adoption of information technologies currently has a global performance, which becomes the most significant positive influence on the motivation and involvement of teachers. That is, the availability of technology, the speed of access, the applications suited to the curriculum and to the pedagogical approach are, more and more, a harmonious set that is compatible with its mission. The study also clarifies that teachers intend to use ICT as they see in them a different didactic tool that allows different approaches, thus increasing, in general, the quality of teaching and learning.

AB  - Background: Advances in digital health and digital learning are transforming the lives of patients, health care providers, and health professional students. In the interdisciplinary field of communication sciences and disorders (CSD), digital uptake and incorporation of digital topics and technologies into clinical training programs has lagged behind other medical fields. There is a need to understand professional and student experiences, opinions, and needs regarding digital health and learning topics so that effective strategies for implementation can be optimized.
   Objective: This cross-sectional survey study aims to interdisciplinarily investigate professional and student knowledge, use, attitudes, and preferences toward digital health and learning in the German-speaking population.
   Methods: An open-ended, web-based survey was developed and conducted with professionals and students in CSD including phoniatricians and otolaryngologists, speech-language pathologists (German: Logopad*innen), medical students, and speech-language pathology students. Differences in knowledge, use, attitudes, and preferences across profession, generation, and years of experience were analyzed.
   Results: A total of 170 participants completed the survey. Respondents demonstrated greater familiarity with digital learning as opposed to eHealth concepts. Significant differences were noted across profession (P<.001), generation (P=.001), and years of experience (P<.001), which demonstrated that students and younger participants were less familiar with digital health terminology. Professional (P<.001) and generational differences were also found (P=.04) in knowledge of digital therapy tools, though no significant differences were found for digital learning tools. Participants primarily used computers, tablets, and mobile phones; non-eHealth-specific tools (eg, word processing and videoconferencing applications); and digital formats such as videos, web courses, and apps. Many indicated a desire for more interactive platforms, such as virtual reality. Significant differences were found across generations for positive views toward digitalization (P<.001) and across profession for feelings of preparedness (P=.04). Interestingly, across profession (P=.03), generation (P=.006), and years of experience (P=.01), students and younger participants demonstrated greater support for medical certification. Commonly reported areas of concern included technical difficulties, quality and validity of digital materials, data privacy, and social presence. Respondents tended to prefer blended learning, a limited to moderate level of interactivity, and time and space-flexible learning environments (63/170, 37.1%), with a notable proportion still preferring traditional time and space-dependent learning (49/170, 28.8%).
   Conclusions: This comprehensive investigation into the current state of CSD student and professional opinions and experiences has shown that incorporation of digital topics and skills into academic and professional development curricula will be crucial for ensuring that the field is prepared for the ever-digitalizing health care environment. Deeper empirical investigation into efficacy and acceptance of digital learning and practice strategies and systematic training and practical organizational supports must be planned to ensure adaptive education and practice.

AB  - Teachers must adapt to the needs of modern society and therefore must be impregnated with solid knowledge marked by new trends. Currently, these trends are built on the foundations of a digital society that must train citizens on the precepts of specific professional and academic competences. In Higher Education these competences imply methodological changes which, in turn, generate subsequent pedagogical innovation processes. Both of them ought to ensure quality in the teaching-learning process, whether in virtual or classroom teaching. Therefore, this new information age compels us to change education from their first links so as to achieve a comprehensive education in the students.
   The new educational reality requires new goals, new skills, new abilities, all of them aimed primarily at personal and social development of students through the teaching-learning processes, in addition to outlining the matters to be taught and the corresponding didactics, as well as the interdisciplinary relationship between them, especially when designing, planning and evaluating.
   The Bologna Declaration process requires a new teacher's profile. New training content is asked to be developed. Future teachers will need to know not just specific contents but new models of teaching, where e-learning becomes more important as a teaching mode that seems to adapt to educative needs. It promotes the presence of experts and resources that are unavailable in traditional classrooms. The use of videoconferencing requires specific formation in didactic application, as well as in the selection of materials to be taught. However, educational contexts do not ensure optimization of this resource. A key aspect lies in the specific training for its educative use, as it presupposes an approach that promotes the integration of academic and interpersonal competences and focuses on the development of good questioning skills which, indeed, are required to develop teaching.
   The innovation process highlights the use of videoconferencing in the new profile of teachers in Bologna process. We will pay attention to the factors involved in teaching process, the difficulty that arises when trying to train students using this approach and the conditions students must have developed before participating in this teaching mode.
   It is clear that the teaching profession can never rest in their initial training, especially in an era of rapid changes in scientific knowledge and technology. The need for teacher training is an undisputed issue in educational settings. It is only raised in scientific debates that deal with models that can guide it, a matter of great current interest because the challenge taken up by the educative system towards to achieve higher levels of quality is linked, among other factors, to continuous improvement of initial (pre-service) and continuing (in-service) teachers, as educational research supports itself. We can state categorically that well-trained teachers, always update their skills. Thus, we will observe some key elements in the development of pedagogical and didactical innovations within Bologna framework.

AB  - The current economic recession has become one of the greatest threats to the inclusion of graduates with higher education in the labor market. In response to this situation of unemployment or low employability, many of the Spanish institutions of higher education, both public and private, are devoting a lot of resources and efforts to encourage the entrepreneurial spirit of its main groups: students and professors. However, many strategies that are being planned are based on traditional pillars that are profoundly changing, such as the closed knowledge and pure business management.
   The social and economic reality supposes a change in perception and values, that is, there should be a move from a management economy to an entrepreneurship economy. This change is still complicated due to the effect of the current legislation on entrepreneurship and the belief that the solution to employability is joining the civil service and not the creation of private business ventures. In this transition, the universities still see themselves as the great contributor and accumulator of knowledge, when, in the current context, new technologies have made knowledge a commodity and the role of the University must be another: it should act as a facilitator and certifier of knowledge.
   However, to educate university students in entrepreneurial dynamic is not synonymous with strictly teaching formal and administrative aspects of entrepreneurship concepts or focus on management and business planning. These skills are necessary, but all the other abilities and competencies required to undertake should not be ignored. The skills that are transmitted must assume an interdisciplinary integration and complementarity, given the wide range of dimensions that embrace the concept of entrepreneurship. All learning methodology or the start of entrepreneurial activity should stimulate effort, promoting the ability to learn by oneself and with others and especially develop thinking and decision skills to facilitate autonomy, confidence and personal initiatives, that is to say the essential capabilities for every entrepreneur. (DNA of the entrepreneur).
   Under this approach, the aim of this contribution is to show a methodology to transfer the values and skills needed to promote entrepreneurship among university students with the technological tools available (open platforms, virtual simulators, etc.) and also the new paradigms of teaching-learning based on cooperative learning, peer learning and the power of networking. This involves clarifying what the stages of every entrepreneurship are, as well as the sequence of skills and knowledge required in each of them.
   Finally, a study is carried out comparing the context in which the entrepreneurial process develops and the characteristics of entrepreneurial activity, employing the data provided by the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM), with the characteristics of university students and initiatives for the improvement of entrepreneurship undertaken by the universities to reduce the still existing gaps, which could include Mentoring activities.

AB  - Purpose - Knowing the students' readiness for the fourth industrial revolution (4IR) is essential to producing competent, knowledgeable and skilled graduates who can contribute to the skilled workforce in the country. This will assist the Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) to ensure that their graduates own skill sets needed to work in the 4IR era. However, studies on students' readiness and preparedness for the 4IR in developing countries such as the Sultanate of Oman are still lacking. Therefore, this study investigates students' readiness level and preparedness for the 4IR. The findings of this study will benefit the HEIs policymakers, administration, faculties, departments, industries and society at large since they will be informed of the student's readiness and preparedness toward industry 4.0.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors adopted the measures from the same context as previous studies in this study. The questionnaire was divided into three sections; the first part described the purpose and introduction of the search with the surety to keep the data confidential. The second part consisted of demographical information like gender, education. The last parts consisted of four subsections, question items in these parts are based on the related previous study. Characteristics consisted of 14 items, knowledge consisted of 18 items related to 4IR technologies, Organizational Dimension comprised of four items related to academic programs, curriculum and training. Preparedness contained two items. The participants have rated all the items in 5-Likert scale.
   Findings - Results from structural equation modeling showed that students' characteristics, knowledge of 4IR technologies and organizational dimensions significantly impact their preparedness for the 4IR. The study also found that organizational dimensions have the highest impact on students' preparedness. Furthermore, the organizational dimension significantly influences students' knowledge of 4IR technology. Moreover, students' characteristics related to 4IR are significantly affected by their knowledge of 4IR technology and organizational dimension. The findings suggest that HEIs are responsible for increasing the adoption of 4IR, and therefore organizational dimensions such as the academic programs, training, technological infrastructure and others are all critical for preparing students for a better future and should be given a priority.
   Research limitations/implications - This study has used academic programs and training to measure the organizational dimension. However, other important factors should be considered, such as technological infrastructure and leadership and governance of HEIs. Second, the current research depends on quantitative data, so future research should implement a mixed methodology (questionnaires, depth interviews, document analysis and focus group) to understand the factors affecting students' readiness for 4IR clearly. Finally, although the 4IR has numerous benefits, it also has challenges in its implementation, so future studies should focus on challenges encountered by different stakeholders in implementing 4IRrelated technologies.
   Practical implications - The curriculum must include mandatory courses related to IT infrastructure design, user experience programming, electronic measurement and control principles, and programming for data science. HEIs should also foster interdisciplinary knowledge by integrating IT, Engineering, Business and Sciences. Furthermore, the HEIs should develop their infrastructure to have smart campuses, labs, classrooms and libraries to make HEIs a space where knowledge can be generated and innovative solutions can be proposed. This entails HEIs offering necessary hardware, software and technical support because if the HEIs improve their technological resources, students will be capable of using 4IR-related technologies effectively.
   Originality/value - The advancement of technology has resulted in the emergence of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR), such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, robotics, cloud computing, data science, virtual reality and 3D printing. It is essential to investigate students' readiness for 4IR. However, there is no study as per researchers' knowledge talked about students readiness in HEIs in the Arab world. This study could be a basis for more research on students' perception of the 4IR covering students from various backgrounds and levels.
