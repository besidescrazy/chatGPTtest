AB  - Incorporation of radiology into anatomy education is a frequently used teaching strategy. Our purpose was to investigate to what extent virtual reality can play a significant role when radiology is taught in conjunction with anatomy. PubMed, SCOPUS, Education Resources Information Center, and Cochrane databases were searched for articles with the aim to evaluate the outcomes of incorporation of radiology in anatomy education, using virtual reality. From each included paper, the following data were extracted: authors, number of participants, type of study (comparative or not), level of outcome according to Kirkpatrick hierarchy, and outcomes of the use of virtual reality when radiology was incorporated in anatomy education.
   Seven papers were included. From them, three were comparative and evaluated students' academic performance after the educational intervention, while four were non-comparative and evaluated only students' opinions about the intervention. In all studies, the use of virtual reality for the incorporation of radiology into anatomy teaching was positively perceived. Also, the three studies which evaluated academic performance showed that virtual reality was effective in terms of enhancing anatomy knowledge.
   The implementation of virtual reality for the incorporation of radiology into anatomy education has been accompanied by positive outcomes. These outcomes may encourage educators to teach radiology in conjunction with anatomy using virtual reality.

AB  - Traditional medical education still focuses on masterclasses and the presentation of the rarest and hardest-to-diagnose diseases, hardly observed in a professional context. Technologies such as virtual reality can enrich educational environments to visualize intricate structures and provide assessment and timely feedback. This study's objective was to analyze whether there is any advantage of teaching with virtual reality vs. traditional education. The quantitative and descriptive approach considered a sample of 120 students in the human neuroanatomy class. They were part of two groups: the control group participated in a traditional class, experimental in a virtual reality session. Their performance was cataloged in: 1-insufficient, 2-under development, and 3-competent. A significant difference was found as the control group obtained a mean of 1.63, while the experimental 2.28. Students who used virtual reality seem to demonstrate better performance in identifying structures and describing the functional implications.

AB  - Presence is the sense of being inside a virtual environment, that can be experienced also in desktop virtual realities not only in full-immersive VRs. MaxWhere is a desktop virtual reality that is used in education and for collaborative work. This VR can be considered as a 3D browser because in the space there are several smartboards where any web-content, document, or image can be displayed. This study compares the sense of presence in MaxWhere virtual reality to other desktop virtual realities with the Igroup Presence Questionnaire. This VR is in focus of numerous scientific research, thus this comparison of presence level could be a great starting point for them. The analysis showed that the level of presence in MaxWhere virtual reality corresponds to the average presence level in other desktop virtual realities. The analysis of the presence profile has shown that the general sense of presence and the spatial presence are relatively high in this VR. The experienced realism scale is the lowest because this VR is designed to foster working and learning inside the virtual space and not for having a high fidelity.

AB  - With the proliferation of Virtual reality headset that are emerging into a consumer-oriented market for video games, it will open new possibilities for exploiting the virtual reality (VR). Therefore, the PRACTICA project is defined as a new service aimed to offering a system for creating courses based on a VR simulator for specialized training companies that allows offering to the students an experience close to reality. The general problem of creating these virtual courses derives from the need to have programmers that can generate them. Therefore, the PRACTICA project allows the creation of courses without the need to program source code. In addition, elements of virtual interaction have been incorporated that cannot be used in a real environment due to risks for the staff, such as the introduction of fictional characters or obstacles that interact with the environment. So to do this, artificial intelligence techniques have been incorporated so these elements can interact with the user, as it may be, the movement of these fictional characters on stage with a certain behavior. This feature offers the opportunity to create situations and scenarios that are even more complex and realistic. This project aims to create a service to bring virtual reality technologies closer and artificial intelligence for non-technological companies, so that they can generate (or acquire) their own content and give it the desired shape for their purposes.

AB  - As many of the common mistakes made by engineering students are based on weak spatial imagination, the use of virtual reality could help to enhance those skills in undergraduate teaching. As part of a university lecture in product development that covers methods of product development and technical design, the use of virtual reality was integrated into an engineering exercise. Supplementing the usual technical tools like CAD, half of the 14 student groups were allowed to use a dedicated VR-application to review their machine designs in virtual reality. While the objective performance of those groups was not better in comparison to the "non-VR" groups, most of the student groups were able to identify design issues or mistakes through the use of VR, which they couldn't find using only CAD. According to interviews, 69.7% of the VR-users reported that they were only able to experience and realize "the true spatial dimensions" through the use of VR.

AB  - According to the current literature, it is unknown whether summarizing can enhance learning and engagement in an immersive environment. To fill this gap, we conducted an experimental study to investigate the potential effects of using summarizing strategy in an immersive virtual reality learning environment on comprehension, cognitive load, and intrinsic motivation. Seventy-five college students were randomly assigned to one of the four conditions formed by a 2 x 2 factorial design with the immersive environment (virtual reality vs. interactive video) as one factor and the use of the summarizing strategy (yes vs. no) as the other factor. The results indicated that (a) summarizing significantly reduced learners' perceived effort; (b) summarizing resulted in lower perceived success than not summarizing in the interactive video condition; and (c) learning from the immersive virtual reality environment led to increased interest and value. These findings suggest the use of appropriate strategies in immersive learning environments.

AB  - Facilitating human learning is one of the uses of virtual reality (VR). Users interact within original and dynamic situations of learning in an integrated learning environment called Virtual Reality Learning Environment (VRLE). Nevertheless, the design of these environments is still considered as a complex task. We intend to study and propose technical and methodological solutions to help teachers to design (adapt or reuse) their pedagogical situation with a scenario-based approach and to operationalize it in a VR learning environment. In this work, we defined a design process allowing teachers to generate their VRLE. Then, we instantiated the proposed design process with a pedagogical situation as an illustrated example.

AB  - Recently, virtual reality seems to be deevloping rapidly. However, it can be said that virtual reality is in the early days of adoption for education. Studies show that using virtual reality in education can positively affect students' learning experiences. In this study, the effect of an educational virtual reality game, named "Kesfet Kurtul", on fourth-grade students' academic achievement in fractions and their engagement to mathematics was investigated. The experimental study was carried out using a quasi-experimental design. The educational VR game was used in the treatment group (N = 32). In the comparison group (N = 32), the method applied in school, which includes predominantly mobile applications developed in fractions, were used. As a result of the research; the educational VR game "Kesfet Kurtul" was found to increase academic achievement and to maintain the level of student engagement in mathematics. It was determined that the experimental method has the same effect as the method applied in school in the comparison group, in terms of academic achievement and student engagement to mathematics. Besides, in terms of social sub-dimension of student engagement, it was observed that Kesfet Kurtul was more effective than the method applied in school.

AB  - Travel is one of the most important tasks in virtual reality (VR) experiences. Paradoxically, the most popular travel techniques in virtual reality games are known to be more likely to cause cybersickness than some of the less popular travel techniques. Recently, at least one VR gaming company shared quantitative data on this issue. In an attempt to explain this data, this work argues that steering techniques might result in stronger immersion, better physical ergonomics, and more pleasure than offered by teleportation techniques. Furthermore, trends are identified that might reduce the preference for steering techniques in the future. The presented discussion of current and future preferences for steering techniques in VR games might help to better understand and design for the needs of VR players.

AB  - Motivation and engagement play a key role in students' academic achievement. With the increasing adoption of virtual reality (VR) technology in language learning in recent years, there arises an urging need to develop an instrument for assessing the influence of VR technology on students' motivation and engagement in language learning. This research aimed to construct the said instrument, namely Motivational and Engagement in Virtual Reality Chinese Language Learning Questionnaires (MEVRCLQ). With a sample of 196 Chinese secondary school students in Hong Kong, the MEVRCLQ was validated with adequate reliability in measuring students' motivation and engagement in the context of VR-assisted Chinese language learning. This is the first study of investigating the association of students' first language (L1) related learning outcomes with motivation and engagement constructs.

AB  - Information and communication technologies (ICT) have spread into all spheres of life. Their existence has influenced the educational process in all its areas, changed or transformed the current setting of the learning process, which can be observed mainly in the education supported by electronic teaching materials. Traditional methods of education change because educational intuitions gradually take on new dimensions mainly because of modern technologies. The Internet and mobile communication change human life at an early stage as children already come into contact with ICT in kindergartens. Nowadays, virtual reality is coming to the fore and the virtual world is becoming part of the learning process. It can be assumed that the trend of using ICT in the educational process will continue to grow. Currently, the virtual reality is rarely being used in teaching process in Slovakia. Despite the fact that we live in modern times, many schools still do not have modern technologies and we often find only basic computer equipment. More than 80% of primary and secondary schools do not have tablets. There are no virtual laboratories, virtual goggles, and smartphones, etc. This problem is currently being addressed in part by the national project called IT Academy - Education for 21st century. This project responds to the demands of the IT sector to adapt the education system to the current and prospective needs of the labor market. Virtual reality can convey a visual experience to the pupils attracting them to better comprehend the selected topic. Moreover, virtual reality has a great potential, especially, in geography teaching as pupils can use it to teleport to different parts of the world to observe the virtual world from different angles or changing their perspective. In particular, the virtual world offers opportunities for pupils to interact with the virtual world, intensive participation, experience, simulation, role-playing and constructive learning. The aim of the paper is to point out the usability of virtual reality, its availability and accessibility not only for geography teaching. In the paper, we also present 360 degrees videos created in virtual reality for teaching the geography of Slovakia as well as local landscape topics.

AB  - The visualization of medical images with advanced techniques, such as augmented reality and virtual reality, represent a breakthrough for medical professionals. In contrast to more traditional visualization tools lacking 3D capabilities, these systems use the three available dimensions. To visualize medical images in 3D, the anatomical areas of interest must be segmented. Currently, manual segmentation, which is the most commonly used technique, and semi-automatic approaches can be time consuming because a doctor is required, making segmentation for each individual case unfeasible. Using new technologies, such as computer vision and artificial intelligence for segmentation algorithms and augmented and virtual reality for visualization techniques implementation, we designed a complete platform to solve this problem and allow medical professionals to work more frequently with anatomical 3D models obtained from medical imaging. As a result, the Nextmed project, due to the different implemented software applications, permits the importation of digital imaging and communication on medicine (dicom) images on a secure cloud platform and the automatic segmentation of certain anatomical structures with new algorithms that improve upon the current research results. A 3D mesh of the segmented structure is then automatically generated that can be printed in 3D or visualized using both augmented and virtual reality, with the designed software systems. The Nextmed project is unique, as it covers the whole process from uploading dicom images to automatic segmentation, 3D reconstruction, 3D visualization, and manipulation using augmented and virtual reality. There are many researches about application of augmented and virtual reality for medical image 3D visualization; however, they are not automated platforms. Although some other anatomical structures can be studied, we focused on one case: a lung study. Analyzing the application of the platform to more than 1000 dicom images and studying the results with medical specialists, we concluded that the installation of this system in hospitals would provide a considerable improvement as a tool for medical image visualization.

AB  - Art painting is a very important major in China's education system. Under the background of the new era, the country vigorously promotes the modernization of education and the development of intelligence. Many subjects of teaching have been more mature and carried out intelligent teaching based on virtual reality technology. But throughout the art painting profession, the research on this aspect is almost blank. The main reason is that there are deep academic barriers between art painting and computer science. Therefore, this paper puts forward the application research of multi-source information art painting fusion interactive 3D dynamic scene virtual reality technology. This paper deeply analyzes the needs of art painting and its teaching reform and believes that the existing virtual reality technology cannot adapt to the teaching environment of art painting. In view of the possible inaccurate calculation and other problems, this paper puts forward the optimization scheme. The core of the scheme is to use the information integration advantages of multi-source information fusion to provide more comprehensive and complete object information for 3D modeling of virtual reality technology, so as to improve the imaging quality of virtual reality technology. In order to meet the requirement of high precision, the calculation method is optimized, the calculation steps are simplified, and the sensor selection is optimized again. This paper introduces the design principle and operation steps of the optimization method in detail. In order to further verify the actual effect of this method, comparative analysis method is used to test the comprehensive performance. In order to ensure the test quality, the median filtering algorithm and fuzzy algorithm are compared. Through the analysis and comparison of the data, the optimization method in this paper greatly improves the accuracy of calculation and the comprehensive performance is improved.

AB  - With the development and evaluation of information technology, virtual reality technology provides opportunities to offer an immersive and interactive experience for supplementing traditional classroom lecture and creating innovative online learning in education curricula and professional training. Given that the arena of 3D entertainment-oriented virtual worlds is creative and quickly evolving, applying a theory-based motivational model to examine the properties of virtual world environments in the context of education remains relatively unexplored territory. Thus, the present study applies the research frameworks of Self-Determination Theory (SDT) and hedonic theory to an understanding of how 3D virtual reality technology contexts satisfy or obstruct psychological needs and thus foster or undermine sustained engagement, affecting behavioral intentions. This study extends existing literature in the field by showing that psychological needs and hedonic experience are important components in understanding virtual reality technology and human interaction. The findings are important in explaining the value of 3D virtual reality technology in educational applications that contribute to the overall enhancement of the learner's motivation and learning experience.

AB  - City University of Hong Kong (CityU) was one of the pioneers in the applications of virtual reality (VR) technology in creative art, humanities and social science. Based on the learning design of a mobile app developed for a CityU MOOC, a smartphone-based solution was adopted to produce an immersive learning package for students to experience certain aspects of a field trip (or study tour). The adoption facilitated pre-class learning which was followed by in-class activities and assessment tasks to achieve the intended learning outcomes, in the context of the flipped classroom approach. Feedback from students indicated increased interest in learning within a virtual tour environment and the alignment of activities to learning outcomes was highly appreciated. Teachers in other local higher education institutions were also attracted by the pedagogical value of such VR field trip. Hence, the production workflow was documented in this paper to further promote the adoption of portable virtual reality technology in teaching and learning.

AB  - This pilot study provides the preliminary results of a Virtual Reality Learning Environment (VRLE) aimed to increase the two aforementioned skills for chemistry graduate students at NC State. For this purpose, a VRLE was built upon four interconnected frameworks: (1) cognitive apprenticeship, (2) familiar shapes recognition, (3) multimedia design principles, and (4) virtual reality learning affordances. The resource's ultimate goal is to reduce the cognitive load associated with mastering the two target skills. The pilot version of the VRLE was tested by 10 graduate students from the Chemistry Department at NC State University. The students tested the VRLE remotely due to Covid-19. Results are presented for one of the students. This work-inprogress project is the first step towards a student-centered, self-paced, immersive virtual resource complementary to traditional lecture for studying and communicating visually demanding organic reactions.

AB  - Engagement has been traditionally linked to presence in desktop-based virtual reality learning environments. Although several studies have been performed to determine other factors affecting cognitive engagement, the role of cognitive load as a factor of student's engagement in desktop-based virtual reality (VR) has received little attention in the literature. The main purpose of this study was to explain if individual dimensions of cognitive load (mental demand, effort, and frustration level) can be used in addition to factors like presence and self-efficacy to predict student's cognitive engagement. The results of the study confirmed presence and self-efficacy as significant predictors of student's engagement. Also, a three-step hierarchical regression analysis revealed that two of the three individual dimensions of cognitive load (effort and frustration level) were also significant predictors of student's engagement.

AB  - Many medical schools are looking to utilize virtual reality (VR); however, due to its novelty, we know little about how VR can be effectively used in medical education. This study evaluates a case-centered VR task that supported students with learning peripheral and collateral circulation, anatomical features that are not easily observed in cadavers. Data sources included a quiz, survey, and focus group. Based on quantitative and qualitative analyses, we support the claim that this activity was an effective use of VR and identify features that made it effective, which can guide other educators who are interested in developing VR activities.

AB  - In this study we assess the effects of teaching fundamental programming concepts through a virtual reality (VR) block-based programming application and its impact on engagement. As a comparison study, participants played an existing desktop-based game (LightBot) and the developed VR game (LogiBot) covering similar gameplay mechanics and block-based programming. Initial results indicate that traditional desktop applications are currently more engaging than VR for teaching programming. We thus identify the need for careful design of interaction methods to support ease of use and reward factors to promote engagement in VR-based learning applications beyond the initial wow-factor.

AB  - Many novice teachers have difficulties with selecting and applying effective classroom management strategies to prevent or diminish disruptive behaviors. Negative experiences with classroom management largely determine teacher wellbeing and early attrition. Therefore, more in-training opportunities are needed to prepare prospective teachers to manage complex classroom practices effectively. A Virtual-Reality environment seems promising in developing classroom management skills (CMS) and promoting teacher resilience; however, students' and educators' perceptions towards this technology influence its potential. This study describes four pre-service teachers' and six school-based teacher educators' experiences with and perceptions towards the use of a Virtual Reality learning environment to train classroom management skills and promote teacher resilience. Responses of semi-structured interviews reflect five themes: software- and equipment-related issues; feedback cues; realism and authenticity; instructor proficiency; and added value for teacher training. Results show that, for most themes, pre-service teachers and school-based teacher educators raised similar remarks and/or suggestions for improvement; however, they differed in their perceptions towards the added value of Virtual Reality to teacher training curricula. Our study highlights teachers' needs for highly authentic and realistic simulations aligned with real-life classrooms and presents recommendations to augment the immersive experience needed for teachers to develop effective CMS and become more resilient.

AB  - Due to the current circumstances of the Corona pandemic, the world has resorted to stopping direct learning and has shifted toward e-learning. However, there appeared obstacles encountered in the e-learning process, namely the practical skills and laboratory experiments that students need to supplement the teaching process. Virtual Reality (VR) techniques can provide models for experimentation with low cost in addition to the time factor savings. The main goal is for adopting an idea to use virtual reality software programs in designing scientific experiments as an alternative method for direct teaching of laboratories. In this study, the perceptions, attitudes and future aspiration of the faculty members of engineering colleges take by questionnaire about the ability to use virtual reality technology in the implementation and design of practical experiments and achieving the targeted educational outcomes.
   The results showed a low percentage use of VR in teaching engineering experiments because this is a new technology and there is a shortage of infrastructures such as equipment, hardware and software in addition to unavailability of workshops and training courses for faculty members and laboratory supervisors. The results also revealed positive perceptions about the importance of VR in distance learning and negative attitudes in adopting VR as an alternative method of teaching engineering experiments.

AB  - Anatomy learning in medical education has been considered a fundamental foundation. The use of cadavers in anatomy studies has been considered the gold standard. However, due to several factors, the use of cadavers in modern medical education was considered irrelevant. As a result, anatomy learning began to involve the use of technology. One of them is using a virtual reality system. Anatomy learning using the virtual reality system relies on the visual field in presenting the information. Many of the bones make up the structure of the human skeleton that we use as our dataset, which raises the problem of visual attention in presenting content in virtual reality systems. For that, we propose a selective visual attention method (a feature that can isolate objects) to improve the user experience. In this study, we develop an experimental design to investigate the effect of our proposed methods on user experience. The developed design offers credible investigative results. To ensure the accuracy of data collection and the accuracy of data analysis from the developed experimental design, we use methods that suit the research needs. The results of this study are in the form of a planned experimental design that can increase readers' confidence in the results of investigations related to user experience.

AB  - Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to foster collaborative science learning, but guidelines for designing in this medium are lacking. This work-in- progress paper explores this gap in the literature through analysis of GeoForge, a multiple-player VR/ digital learning experience where users collaboratively explore planetary systems. A mixed-methods study at 3 middle schools used teacher interviews, student survey responses, and student work to examine how GeoForge encouraged information exchange and reflection within small student groups. Our findings indicate students shared ideas and resources, engaged in coconstruction, and teachers recognized high student engagement throughout the experience.

AB  - The 3D visualization program paves the way for the development of virtual reality. This study produces a 3D visualization program in virtual reality to increase high school students' critical thinking skills and scientific attitude. The Research and Development (R&D) method was based on the ADDLE model - analysis, design, develop, implement, and evaluate with quasi experimental posttest design. The data of students' scientific attitude was collected through questionnaire adapted from several books and jounals, and those of the students' critical thinking skills was collected through chemical bonding test. A total of 96 grade 10th students were cluster randomly selected from senior high school in Gunungkidul Regency, Yogyakarta, Indonesia. The samples were set into three different classes, namely Class CG using a wet laboratory, Class EG-1 using a virtual reality laboratory integrated hybrid learning, and Class EG-2 using both of them. Based on the MANOVA test, it was found that students who used 3D visualization had better results in critical thinking skills and scientific attitudes.

AB  - Immersive VR (virtual reality) applications usually require styles and devices of human-computer interaction other than the conventional ones like mouse and keyboard, as the user typically wears a head-mounted display and does not see his/her real environment. Moreover, such interaction is usually three-dimensional. This is where relatively new (or at least previously not dominant) paradigms come into the picture: natural user interface (NUI) and gestures. The paper overviews some definitions for these and discusses the communicative aspects of gestures. The abovementioned paradigms affect the process of interaction design, which has to be even more thorough, more conscious than before. If we use gestures for input, the actual requirements of the application have to be analyzed in detail and decision about gesture "vocabulary" has to he taken. In the paper, an actual implementation under development is discussed: the interaction - consisting of navigation in 3D space and manipulation of virtual objects - in an immersive VR application simulating the conventional control room of a nuclear power plant. The implementation is touchless, using a hand movement detector.

AB  - The present work proposes the creation of a Virtual Reality tool that allows students to learn basic concepts of programming and computational thinking with the purpose that they enjoy the technology and feel motivated to learn more. The tool is a Visual Programming Language; the algorithms are formed by block-assembly, thereby solving one of the students' main problems, which are "syntax errors". In addition, the tool brings with it a set of level-ordered challenges aimed at teaching students basic principles of programming and logic (sequential programming, repetitive and conditional control structure), where at each level the student will learn the different concepts and behaviors of computational thinking. For the evaluations with the users we counted on the participation of 18 students between 12 and 15 years old coining from two public institutions of Rio de Janeiro. In these evaluations it was also considered to measure the sensation of immersion through Telepresence, Social Presence and Usability.

AB  - Virtual reality catches individuals' consideration. This innovation has been applied in numerous divisions, for example, medication, industry, training, computer games, or the travel industry. Maybe its most significant zone of intrigue has been relaxation and amusement. In any case, the part, the presentation of virtual or increased reality had a few limitations: it was costly, it had poor ergonomics, or inferred an excessive amount of work to make the substance. This study gives a general view of virtual reality applications that used primarily in the education sector. Late mechanical developments, including the quick selection of cell phones by society, have encouraged the entrance to computer-generated reality and enlarged the truth of anybody. Instructive organizations profit by better openness to virtual innovations. VR will make it conceivable to educate in virtual situations that are difficult to picture in physical study halls, such as getting into virtual research facilities, imagining machines, mechanical plants, or even clinical cases. The gigantic prospects of open virtual advancements will make it conceivable to break the limits of formal instruction.

AB  - While virtual reality has attracted educators' interest by providing new opportunities to the learning process and assessment in different science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) subjects, the results from previous studies indicate that there is still much work to be done when large data collection and analysis is considered. At the same time, learning analytics emerged with the promise to revolutionise the traditional practices by introducing new ways to systematically assess and improve the effectiveness of instruction. However, the collection of 'big' educational data is mostly associated with web-based platforms (i.e., learning management systems) as they offer direct access to students' data with minimal effort. Thence, in the context of this work, we present a four-dimensional theoretical framework for virtual reality-supported instruction and propose a set of structural elements that can be utilised in conjunction with a learning analytics prototype system. The outcomes of this work are expected to support practitioners on how to maximise the potential of their interventions and provide further inspiration for the development of new ones.

AB  - Virtual reality stands as a discourse beyond technology, with increasing visibility in all social areas, and becoming one of the protagonists of cyberculture. Advertising is no stranger to this boom of immersive storytelling, and it is becoming usual that campaigns with a transmedia approach use this resource in the face of other narratives and channels of dissemination. Among the existing publics, minors are especially sensitive to the messages to which they are exposed, and therefore must be protected. There is a multitude of studies whose central axis is occupied by this social sector, although there are few studies that interrelate it with digital advertising. In this paper, virtual reality and its presence on YouTube are conceptually exposed, analyzing its advertising use focused on minors. The present investigation tries to elucidate if the immersive advertising complies with the strict control parameters of conventional advertising in its dealings with the minors, and analyzes the convenience of consumption of these campaigns for this public, as well as in what conditions its application is recommended.

AB  - MYR is a browser-based, educational platform built to spark student interest in computer science by allowing users to write code that generates three-dimensional, animated scenes in virtual reality. The interface consists of two primary components: (1) an integrated editor, which leverages the MYR API and the A-Frame entity-component-system, and (2) a real-time renderer that displays the corresponding scene. The scenes, which vary in complexity, are viewable using virtual reality headsets, smartphones, and any device that supports a web browser.
   By providing access to the specific domain of virtual reality to students, the system aims to make computer science concepts tangible for novice programmers. The MYR development team conducted pilot tests with middle school students in order to collect feedback from this audience. The larger goal of the project is to develop MYR as a research tool to gain insight into computing students' success, motivation, and confidence in learning computing.
   The technical implementation, the results of the pilot tests, and the larger vision for future work are discussed in this paper.

AB  - ObjectiveTo investigate whether a virtual reality learning environment (VRLE) enhanced student understanding and knowledge compared with a traditional tutorial. MethodA randomized controlled trial involving medical students from University College Dublin, Ireland. Participants were assigned to an intervention (VRLE involving a 15-min learning experience on the stages of fetal development) or control (PowerPoint tutorial on the same topic) group. Multiple choice questionnaires (MCQs) assessed knowledge at three time points: preintervention, immediately postintervention, and 1 week postintervention. Primary outcomes were differences in MCQ knowledge scores postintervention between groups. Secondary outcomes included attitudes on the learning experience assessed using the Student Satisfaction and Self-Confidence in Learning Scale (SCLS) and the Virtual Reality Design Scale (VRDS). ResultsNo statistically significant between-group differences were found in the primary outcome assessing postintervention knowledge scores. Within-group differences in knowledge scores were significant among the three time points for both the intervention (P < 0.01 [95% confidence interval, 5.33-6.19]) and control (P = 0.02 [95% confidence interval, 5.74-6.49]) groups. Mean levels of satisfaction and self-confidence in learning were higher in the intervention group compared with the control group: 54.2 (standard deviation, 7.5) and 50.5 (standard deviation, 7.2), respectively (P = 0.21). ConclusionVRLEs are a learning tool that can support knowledge development.

AB  - As educational reform efforts continue, a challenge for most adaptive learning software is how to integrate theoretical knowledge with practice, especially in the field of engineering education. Developing an understanding of how to incorporate virtual reality in education to enhance the quality of learning has become a research hotspot in the e-learning field. For this purpose, a novel adaptive virtual reality learning method based on learning styles model is proposed in this paper, then a virtual reality learning system for engineering education is constructed based on the proposed approach. In this method, learning style are categorized via learning style index to predict learning preferences, then differentiated virtual learning environment of engineering education are provided to students according to their individual learning preferences. During the learning process, various types of learning data are recorded and analyzed automatically. Then the prejudged learning preferences are continually adjusted by the learning data when the immersive learning experience is offered to students by the customization of learning scene and teaching material in virtual environment. To adapt to differentiated individuals, the structure and content of virtual learning environment are gradually optimized, with the ultimate goal of equipping the environment to meet an unlimited array of actual student learning needs. Compared with the traditional adaptive learning method based on learning style, a comparison of experimental results shows that the proposed method is more effective in stimulating learner enthusiasm and can greatly improve student academic performance.

AB  - Didactical Design has been proposed as an act of modeling processes in educational settings. It is an interplay of several pedagogical elements to strengthen teaching and learning processes. The term didactic originates from the Scandinavian and German concept of Dldaktlk; which focuses upon the relationship between content- student-teacher, whilst explicitly emphasizing the distinction between teaching practice and student learning. The Didaktik method embraces what to learn (Le., curriculum and content), when to learn (e.g., in what kinds of situations and locations), and how learning can be achieved (e.g., self-regulated learning). This work-in-progress proposes Didactical Design as the science of planning and performing, where both teaching and learning is a social practice, subsequently demonstrating a particular design form for education in Virtual Reality.

AB  - Digital technologies such as the Internet have considerably changed distance learning (DL), enabling new forms of sharing and consuming information. Notably, the so-called virtual learning environments (VLE) consist of educational systems designed to support DL activities. However, VLEs usually do not focus on social interactions among participants, which is also point out as a strong avoidance factor for DL courses. Thus, in this work, we propose assimilating the concepts of interactive and immersive virtual reality environments to devise a VLE, called AVRA, to offer a better learning experience. The analysis shows the AVRA prototype achieves its purpose with satisfactory usability, considering the opinions of two groups of students. In conclusion, we point out lessons learned in this research and provide insights for further developments.

AB  - As a complex three-dimensional organ, the inside of a human brain is difficult to properly visualize. Magnetic Resonance Imaging provides an accurate model of the brain of a patient, but its medical or educational analysis as a set of flat slices is not enough to fully grasp its internal structure. A virtual reality application has been developed to generate a complete three-dimensional model based on MRI data, which users can explore internally through random planar cuts and color cluster isolation. An indexed vertex triangulation algorithm has been designed to efficiently display large amounts of complex three-dimensional vertex clusters in simple mobile devices. Feedback from students suggests that the resulting application satisfactorily complements theoretical lectures, as virtual reality allows them to better observe different structures within the human brain.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this study was to explore the utility of a virtual reality (VR) classroom experience for improving the capacity of instructional leaders. Specifically, school leaders used VR to build their classroom observation and analysis skills to prepare to have more effective post-observation conversations with teachers. The authors provide insights from multiple data points that highlight the affordances of the virtual setting for improving classroom observation skills. Design/methodology/approach Drawing on the application of simulations to practice classroom observations, the authors developed a VR experience in which participants tag observable elements of academic discourse using codes from two observation protocols. The protocols identify elements of equitable student access: how teachers call on students and how they design questions. Seventy-five school leaders used the VR platform to observe a classroom scenario and code evidence of equitable classroom access. The authors analyzed data from tagging in the virtual reality scenario and triangulated these data with survey data focused on observation practices from participants' schools. A reflection component is included on the platform to collect these qualitative data. Findings The study results indicate that the virtual reality platform provides an innovative process for leadership professional development focused on building school leaders' capacity to identify elements of academic discourse during classroom observations. Participants reported that the opportunity to practice classroom observations in a risk-free environment was useful. However, for school leaders to fully transfer the data to using in conversations with teachers, they benefit from leadership coaching. Originality/value This study ascertains the potential effectiveness of an advanced technology for enhancing instructional leadership by using evidence-based classrooms observations to drive improvements in teaching practice. Beyond the utility of the virtual reality tool, this study provides a proof of concept for the next generation of instructional leadership through teacher observations with augmented reality.

AB  - Background The Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic brought significant disruption to in-hospital medical training. Virtual reality simulating the clinical environment has the potential to overcome this issue and can be particularly useful to supplement the traditional in-hospital medical training during the COVID-19 pandemic, when hospital access is banned for medical students. The aim of this study was to assess medical students' perception on fully online training including simulated clinical scenarios during COVID-19 pandemic. Methods From May to July 2020 when in-hospital training was not possible, 122 students attending the sixth year of the course of Medicine and Surgery underwent online training sessions including an online platform with simulated clinical scenarios (Body Interact (TM)) of 21 patient-based cases. Each session focused on one case, lasted 2 h and was divided into three different parts: introduction, virtual patient-based training, and debriefing. In the same period, adjunctive online training with formal presentation and discussion of clinical cases was also given. At the completion of training, a survey was performed, and students filled in a 12-item anonymous questionnaire on a voluntary basis to rate the training quality. Results were reported as percentages or with numeric ratings from 1 to 4. Due to the study design, no sample size was calculated. Results One hundred and fifteen students (94%) completed the questionnaire: 104 (90%) gave positive evaluation to virtual reality training and 107 (93%) appreciated the format in which online training was structured. The majority of participants considered the platform of virtual reality training realistic for the initial clinical assessment (77%), diagnostic activity (94%), and treatment options (81%). Furthermore, 97 (84%) considered the future use of this virtual reality training useful in addition to the apprenticeship at patient's bedside. Finally, 32 (28%) participants found the online access difficult due to technical issues. Conclusions During the COVID-19 pandemic, online medical training including simulated clinical scenarios avoided training interruption and the majority of participant students gave a positive response on the perceived quality of this training modality. During this time frame, a non-negligible proportion of students experienced difficulties in online access to this virtual reality platform.

AB  - This paper presents the analyzed results of a virtual reality application which allows measuring spatial skills of the users. The application contains mental rotation tests of three types and can be used on a computer with desktop displays and on Android with the Gear VR device. The authors measured the spatial ability of 61 students with the Gear VR and of 240 students with a desktop display. By investigating the correct answer ratios, comparisons were done between the age, the gender, the primary hand, what the students are majoring in, moreover the display devices. The use of the Gear VR significantly improved on the average performance of female students by 18.02%, on left-handed students by 18.66%, on older students by 7.29% and made the purdue spatial visualization test easier by 17.21% compared to the use of a desktop display. These results also strengthen the fact that education has a future in virtual reality.

AB  - Background: Military members and veterans exhibit higher rates of injuries and illnesses such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) because of their increased exposure to combat and other traumatic scenarios. Novel treatments for PTSD are beginning to emerge and increasingly leverage advances in gaming and other technologies, such as virtual reality. Without assessing the degree of technology acceptance and perception of usability to the end users, including the military members, veterans, and their attending therapists and staff, it is difficult to determine whether a technology-based treatment will be used successfully in wider clinical practice. The Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology model is commonly used to address the technology acceptance and usability of applications in 5 domains.
   Objective: Using the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology model, the purpose of this study was to determine the technology acceptance and usability of multimodal motion-assisted memory desensitization and reconsolidation (3MDR) on a virtual reality system in the primary user group (military members and veterans with treatment-resistant PTSD, 3MDR therapists, and virtual reality environment operators).
   Methods: This mixed methods embedded pilot study included military members (n=3) and veterans (n=8) with a diagnosis of combat-related PTSD, as well as their therapists (n=13) and operators (n=5) who completed pre-post questionnaires before and on completion of 6 weekly sessions of 3MDR. A partial least squares structural equation model was used to analyze the questionnaire results. Qualitative data from the interviews were assessed using thematic analysis.
   Results: Effort expectancy, which was the most notable predictor of behavioral intention, increased after a course of 3MDR with the virtual reality system, whereas all other constructs demonstrated no significant change. Participants' expectations of the technology were met, as demonstrated by the nonsignificant differences in the pre-post scores. The key qualitative themes included feasibility and function, technical support, and tailored immersion.
   Conclusions: 3MDR via a virtual reality environment appears to be a feasible, usable, and accepted technology for delivering 3MDR to military members and veterans who experience PTSD and 3MDR therapists and operators who facilitate their treatment.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to investigate whether the feedback designed based on EEG (electroencephalography) signals contributes to an individual's creative performance in an immersive virtual reality setting. Two specific forms of feedback were used. The first one was "reminder feedback," given when brain waves indicated the participant's attention was not concentrated. The second one was "encouraging feedback," given when brainwaves indicated that the participant's attention was very concentrated. Sixty high school students were randomly assigned to participate in an open-ended design challenge in an immersive virtual reality setting. Twenty (N = 20) participants received no feedback; twenty (N = 20) participants received reminder feedback; and another twenty (N = 20) participants received encouraging feedback. Findings showed that the participants who received reminder feedback had higher-quality creative products than those in a group with no feedback or encouraging feedback. In addition, EEG feedback also had an impact on the participant's attention and flow state. These findings are discussed in terms of feedback impacts, study limitations, and future research directions.

AB  - This paper provides a review of the current state of the gender gap in computer science and highlights how immersive games can mitigate this issue. Game-based learning (GBL) applications have been shown to successfully incite motivation in students and increase learning efficiency in both formal and non-formal educational settings. With the rise of GBL, researchers have also used virtual reality to provide pupils with a more immersive learning experience. Both GBL and virtual reality techniques are also used for computer programming education. However, there is a paucity of applications that utilize these techniques to incite interest in computer science from a female perspective. This is a cause for concern as immersive games have been proven to be capable of inciting affective motivation and fostering positive attitudes towards specific subjects. Hence, this review summarises the benefits and limitations of GBL and virtual reality; how males and females respond to certain game elements; and suggestions to aid in the development of immersive games to increase female participation in the field of computer science.

AB  - In this article, the author analyzes the ways in which the practices of virtual reality design are being standardized, focusing specifically on the Oculus Best Practices Guide (OBPG). Instructional writings like the OBPG are fruitful documents from which theories of practice can be extracted and, for companies like Oculus, they serve as alternative mission statements, articulating what Oculus wants and needs the standards and practices of its nascent product-medium to be. The author argues that the OBPG serves to create standards and practices that emphasize and maintain virtual reality (VR) user immersion in order to mitigate the weaknesses in the technology and better conform with VR's idealized, hypothetical presentation in fiction and marketing rhetoric. The Guide plays a key role in Oculus's larger attempts to mitigate market risk through the standardization of content across its distribution platforms in order to shape an inchoate technological object into a stable and lucrative entertainment medium. More broadly, the OBPG serves as an example of the specific ways in which market forces act on the development of new media practices, turning 'standards' into 'industry standards'.

AB  - Understanding object-oriented programming (OOP) and its underlying concepts is essential in any computing-related field. However, learning the OOP concepts is often daunting for novice programmers due to their abstract nature. This paper presents a systematic approach of creating interactive learning activities for OOP concepts aligned with fundamental learning outcomes and misconceptions. The strategy combines analogies and visualisation to deliver concepts without students feeling distracted or overwhelmed by the technicalities inherent in textual code. A virtual reality implementation was developed, to help promote immersion and engagement with the abstract OOP concepts. The app was evaluated with CS2 students (n= 17), with the results showing a significant improvement in students' ability to visualise the targeted OOP concepts. Students responded positively and agreed it was an effective learning tool to complement lectures.

To promote students' understanding of specific immunology concepts and increase their learning motivation and engagement, we leveraged the strengths of immersive storytelling and virtual reality (VR) interactivity and created a guided interactive and immersive VR storytelling experience with rich characters and engaging narratives. The experience builds on immunology concepts of a specific type of white blood cell called neutrophils, and it takes students on an exciting journey inside the human body by embodying the cell and fighting pathogens. In this demo paper, we will describe the design of a working prototype of the VR application.

CP  - 2020 Physics Education Research Conference (PERC)
AB  - Providing students with opportunities to develop models in the introductory physics lab is made difficult by the dearth of physical phenomena that are both accessible to students at the introductory level and aren't easily found with a Google search. In response to this difficulty, we have developed a set of laboratory activities that leverage the unique affordances of virtual reality to provide a learning opportunity in which introductory physics students engage in the authentic practice of physics model development for a novel phenomenon. We present preliminary evidence of expert-like modeling behaviors, both in the context of hypothesis generation and in the context of modeling a measurement tool, as well as suggestions how virtual reality labs can be engineered to target other laboratory learning outcomes. Further, we discuss difficulties associated with this approach to curriculum design and ways they might be mitigated.

AB  - The possibilities of using the new software of virtual reality NeoTrie VR (or Neotrie) to teach geometry to children aged 11- 14 years old are presented. This software is tested for the first time as a part of math lessons at a School in Zernica (Poland). The use of Neotrie has made it easier to eliminate some of the problems faced by the pupils in the early stages of geometry learning. Moreover, the participating students solve geometric tasks more quickly, compared with previous years, especially those that require spatial imagination and those with a higher degree of difficulty. Since the program has been implemented, pupils are more active and prone to cooperation, and to formulate conclusions. Neotrie turns out to be a useful tool for teaching Geometry, it helps students to better organize their geometric knowledge in a ludic way, to increase their spatial reasoning and creativity.

AB  - In recent years, visuospatial cognitive functions, which play a crucial role in human cognition, have sparked interest among psychologists and neuroscientists, focusing on assessment, training and restoration of these functions. Virtual reality, recognized as a modern technology, addressing the real-life aspects of visuospatial processing, provides an immersive environment that can be used for stimulation of cognitive functions and its effects that can be measured afterwards. In this paper, we describe an experimental design that involves cognitive testing and targeted, cognitively-oriented, stimulation in an immersive 3D virtual environment, rendered by a unique CAVE system. We focus primarily on a game, designed and developed to serve as the virtual environment. We also describe the experimental procedure that includes the measurement of an electrophysiological neural correlate of spatial working memory capacity - contralateral delay activity.

AB  - This study explores how a virtual reality (VR) design tool can enhance designers' cognitive action and creativity in the design process. Ten fashion designers participated in cognitive protocol research and in-depth interviews. Regarding the idea generation process's cognitive action, we limited the experiment to the sketch phase early in the design process and selected a 2D digital design tool for comparison. Expert reviews were also conducted to evaluate the creativity of design outcomes. As a result, we found that the immersive VR design tool activated physical and perceptual action in design cognition and enhanced flexible cognitive action amongst different cognitive action levels compared to the 2D digital design tool. Consequently, we found that the enhanced flexibility in the cognitive process in VR reinforced divergent design thinking in design concept generation and was connected with creative design outcomes.

As a result of statistical data processing, it was shown that the study participants experienced significant changes in non-verbal creativity indica-tors - "originality" (at p <= 0.05) and "uniqueness" (at p <= 0.01). The vectors for further research on the problem of the connection between creative activity, creativity of the individual and virtual reality are determined.

AB  - Extensive training is mandatory for medical students during their academic studies. However, the shortage of training personnel, patients' safety, scarcity of equipment are the key limitations that hinder the training process. To address these challenges, we built PathogeniusVR, a virtual reality application for training physicians to interact and diagnose patients. We also conducted a preliminary study on 8 participants to collect their initial feedback about our prototype. Our results suggest that PathogeniusVR is immersive and more entertaining than case study diagnosing.

AB  - The creativity of the brain is usually measured by one's creative behavior or activity. This study explores connections between an individual's creative behavior and his or her creative brain by asking each participant to design an open-ended virtual product in an integrated system consisting of virtual reality and brainwaves. The results show a significant correlation between the individual creativity level and the state of flow. There is a significant correlation between the state of flow and the quality of the creative product. The attention value is correlated significantly with the quality of product. The participants' four different behaviors significantly demonstrated different attention and meditation levels. The sequential analysis shows that people with high product creativity have a higher attention value while maintaining a state of relaxation, demonstrated during the behavior of painting in the virtual reality environment. Given a limited period of time, a higher level of product creativity can be achieved through persistent implementation, concentration, and by being relaxed both physically and mentally. Implications of the study on teaching, learning, and designing a creative learning environment will be discussed.

AB  - The contribution deals with the importance of virtual reality (VR) within the contemporary world and its impact on essential human needs. Technological advances are expanding, they are less limiting, and so now, more so than ever before, these new experiences allow people to gain attributes which help to develop their skills and personality as well. One of the primary objectives of the VR games is entertainment, but VR is used also beyond the realm of entertaining, and expands into other fields like art, various abilities' trainings, psychology, journalism and even complementing traditional education. Although, VR is not an entirely new technology, the genesis of which being a somewhat debatable topic that depends on its specific definition, what characterizes it and what fundamentally defines it both technologically and as an experience. In recent years considerable progress has been made on its technological side, making it currently more usable, reliable and affordable than ever before. The theoretical part of the study is devoted to the first technologies, which can be considered as the base of VR, defines key terms such as simulation, virtual worlds and virtual reality systems, specifies the essence of VR and its compatibility with different devices. In the research part, we focus on the education through VR games and the use of the VR technology to raise awareness in selected ecological issues. The objective is to introduce the possibilities of using VR games in the process of environmental education focusing on different target groups. We propose a solution through a specific game that has been already created to be compatible with virtual reality and focuses on separating waste with an aim to increase environmental knowledge, eco-innovation awareness and sustainability.

AB  - Serious Games (SG) have proved to have instructional benefits and recent developments in formal methodologies and tools support their design, analysis, validation, and assessment. Fully immersive Virtual Reality (VR) is increasingly used in an educational context where adoption and practical use is growing, facilitated by more powerful and affordable VR headsets. Teaching the fundamentals of mathematics and its applied use can be challenging. In this paper, we propose the use of SG, VR, and the Learning Mechanics-Game Mechanics (LM-GM) framework for SG game analysis in the design of a game. The goal is to develop mathematical thinking skills and increase student engagement and retention through the use of gamification in the creation of a highly engaging and pedagogically sound immersive learning experience.

AB  - Virtual reality applications turn abstract concepts into experienceable phenomena and present exciting opportunities to transform science education and public outreach practices. While research has started to look into the affordances of virtual reality (VR) in the formal science education context, the potential of these technologies to enhance public engagement with science is largely unexplored. To improve the way that VR may be used in informal learning and public outreach contexts, the purpose of our study was to undertake evidence-based investigations that shed light onto the relationship between VR and public engagement. Aiming to identify and develop the benefits of VR technologies, we propose a conceptual framework for engagement with VR at a science festival that comprises four aspects of participant activity: immersion, facilitation, collaboration, and visualisation. This framework guided the research design of our exploratory case study of one VR tour at a science festival. Data included visitor surveys, video recordings, VR screen captures, and focus group interviews with outreach and science professionals. Our findings reveal important ways that VR supports visitor engagement at a science festival. More generally, these findings and our framework contribute to the ongoing efforts of engaging the public with science in more diverse informal learning contexts.

AB  - The field of Virtual Reality has been developing at a steady pace, and VR is finding new uses as a support for creative tasks. The objective of this study is to propose a theoretical model describing the links between user experience and creativity. Pre-existing theoretical links have been identified in relevant scientific literature. Two experiments were then conducted in order to identify new links and replicate results. These experiments involved respectively 76 and 42 participants who individually performed a task requiring divergent creativity using virtual reality drawing tools. The results indicate that cybersickness leads to a decrease in fluency, i.e. the number of ideas generated, but also shades the links between flow and the relevance of the ideas generated. On the basis of this result, we propose the CRUX model to lead to recommendations for the design of tools and simulations to support divergent creativity.

AB  - The interaction time of students who did spatial ability tests in a virtual reality environment is analyzed. The spatial ability test completion times of 240 and 61 students were measured. A desktop display as well as the Gear VR were used by the former group and by the latter one, respectively. Logistic regression analysis was used to investigate the relationship between the probability of correct answers and completion times, while linear regression was used to evaluate effects and interactions of following factors on test completion times: the users' gender and primary hand, test type and device used. The findings were that while the completion times are not significantly affected by the users' primary hand, other factors have significant effects on them: they are decreased by the male gender in itself, while they are increased by solving Mental Rotation Tests or by using the Gear VR. The largest significant increment in interaction time in virtual reality during spatial ability tests is when Mental Rotation Tests are accomplished by males with the Gear VR, while the largest significant decrease in interaction time is when Mental Cutting Tests are completed with a desktop display.

AB  - The aim of using virtual reality (VR) as a medical training tool is to offer additional means to teach students and to improve the quality of medical skills. A novel system was developed to fulfil the requirements of modern medical education and overcome the challenges faced by both students and lecturers in the process of knowledge transfer. A heart three-dimensional model presented in a virtual reality (VR) environment has been implemented in order to facilitate a new educational modality. This paper reports the outcome of a comparative study between traditional medical teaching modalities and virtual reality technology. This study was conducted in the Faculty of Medicine in the University of Jordan. The participants were asked to perform system trials and experiment with the system by navigating through the system interfaces, as well as being exposed to the traditional physical model of the human heart that is currently used in the faculty during practical anatomy sessions. Afterwards, they were asked to provide feedback via a comparative questionnaire. The participants' replies to the questions regarding the Physical Heart Model and VR heart anatomy system were assessed for reliability using Cronbach's alpha. The first group's (Physical Heart Model questions) alpha value was 0.689. The second group's (VR heart anatomy system questions) alpha value was 0.791. Comparing students' experience results between the traditional method (Physical Heart Model) and the VR heart anatomy system, the mean scores showed a distinct increase in the values. This indicates that the developed system enhanced their experience in anatomy learning and the provided tools improved their understanding of heart anatomy. Results demonstrated the usefulness of the system by showing a higher satisfaction rate for the provided tools regarding structure and visualisation.

AB  - Digital outcrop models (DOMs) have facilitated quantitative and qualitative studies in digital and virtual environments of source and reservoir rock analogs important to the oil industry. The use of immersive virtual reality (iVR) to extend field experiences has motivated several research groups to develop software integrating iVR techniques with tools to interpret and derive geological information from DOMs. This virtual approach can also contribute to the development of geological and spatial thinking skills taught in the classroom and during field trips. The immersive virtual field trips (iVFTs) can provide students access to outcrops and additional data restricted to field learning activities while allowing additional interactions impossible in the field. iVFTs have been developed recently; however, the structuring of iVFTs for geology classes has not been presented in a way that inexperienced iVR users can make use of such systems. In this scenario, our work proposes a method to structure an iVFT using georeferenced data containers and the virtual reality software Mosis LAB while evaluating users' perceptions during an iVFT study case. The evaluation using technology acceptance model questionnaires showed that users were positively impacted by the observational iVFT experience, effectively supporting e-learning, and class field learning activities and preparations. This approach allows field trip experiences in less accessible study sites, especially in less favorable conditions like the ones during the Coronavirus 2019 pandemic where many geoscience departments had their field trips hampered.

AB  - A relatively new technology being used to deliver academic lessons is immersive virtual reality (IVR). This study examined whether IVR is a more effective instructional medium than other multimedia, such as a video on a computer monitor. Additionally, this study explored the underlying affective and cognitive mechanisms of learning in an immersive environment. Participants viewed a history lesson in IVR or a 3D interactive video display on a desktop monitor. The results showed that participants who viewed the video lesson outperformed those who viewed the IVR lesson on transfer tests. The IVR lesson caused higher emotional arousal based on self-report and heart rate measures, and lower cognitive engagement based on electroencephalogram (EEG) measures. The results suggest that immersive environments may create excessive positive emotions, which distract form the necessary cognitive processing during the lesson, thereby harming performance on subsequent tests of learning outcomes.

AB  - Safety training is essential to high danger jobs. It is normally conducted in the traditional ways of classroom teaching or physical training at the workspace. In classroom teaching, safety procedures are theoretically described, the trainees cannot physically feel or see the machines or tools. Whereby safety training in the real-life workspace for high risk and high danger jobs often poses a risk by directly exposing the trainee to the danger area. In this project, a quiz-based interactive Virtual Reality (VR) simulated workshop was developed which allows training to be carried out in a realistic yet harmless environment, with the aims to improve the effectiveness of safety training and to reduce the incidents in the workshop. Studies were done to compare both the traditional classes and the VR system. Results show that the VR system is more effective, the trainees who took the VR training scored higher in the test compared to trainees who attended the normal classes.

AB  - Medicinal chemistry (MC) is an indispensable component of the pharmacy curriculum. The pharmacists' unique knowledge of a medicine's chemistry enhances their understanding of the pharmacological activity, manufacturing, storage, use, supply, and handling of drugs. However, chemistry is a challenging subject for both teaching and learning. These challenges are typically caused by the inability of students to construct a mental image of the three-dimensional (3D) structure of a drug molecule from its two-dimensional presentations. This study explores a prototype virtual reality (VR) gamification option, as an educational tool developed to aid the learning process and to improve the delivery of the MC subject to students. The developed system is evaluated by a cohort of 41 students. The analysis of the results was encouraging and provided invaluable feedback for the future development of the proposed system.

AB  - This paper presents a prototype of a virtual reality (VR) system to teach the basic concepts of programming called VR-OCKS. The system is inspired by other visual languages such as Scratch or Kodu, and it works by proposing to the user the resolution of simple puzzles in a 3D environment. Several basic commands to a humanoid character, such as advance or turn, together with control flow structures like iteration and conditional selections, are needed to provide a solution for increasingly difficult challenges. Our aim is to attract users, usually children and teenagers, into the world of programming by taking advantage of the appeal and potential of VR. The use of VR-OCKS strengthened the spatial orientation and autonomy of the users, in addition to enhancing common sense, creative thinking, and systematic reasoning. In our experiments, VR-OCKS was accepted by adults and children alike and it showed great potential as an educational tool.

AB  - Unlike classical physics, quantum physics is harder to explain, as it involves very small scales and phenomena that are not visible to the naked eye. Understanding the differences between classical and quantum physics is difficult, especially for children, who cannot grasp the subtleties conveyed in complicated formulae.
   We propose to achieve this in a playful and immersive manner, which is a more familiar and convenient way to introduce children to new concepts. For this we developed Save Schrodinger's Cat, a puzzle game in virtual reality featuring a classical physics mode and a quantum physics mode. As virtual objects and phenomena behave differently in each mode, this mechanic encourages players to toggle between modes, in order to explore the differences between quantum and classical physics in an immersive, entertaining and challenging way. A preliminary evaluation showed that players could better identify various distinguishing features of either mode.

AB  - Recently, the use of digital education such as three-dimensional virtual reality (3D VR) technology has become a promising system to aid learning and training in learning anatomy. In the medical sciences, it is important to understand the main concepts of anatomy before interacting with or performing procedures on patients. This technology helps the user to enhance their learning experience, as well as improving immersion, concentration, interest, enjoyment, and knowledge. While there are numerous articles on specific applications of VR in medicine, there are only a small number of systematic works currently exists on how researchers have applied the VR, especially in studies of anatomy. This study presents a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) on the use of VR and the type of VR technologies used in anatomy education. It is based on articles published on PubMed digital libraries from 1999 to 2020 and aims to describe the landscape and trajectory of development for the use of VR technology in anatomy education.

This paper addresses the possibility to cultivate reflection and empathy skills using a VR based framework targeting to maximize the professional development of teachers. Reflection and empathy are skills of paramount importance for teachers and an integral part of their professional development. The current research aims to investigate possible differences in cultivating reflection and empathy skills between participants who used a VR system and the control group who were trained in a real classroom environment. Experimental results indicate that the participants using the virtual classroom environment were able to better reflect and empathize with the students whereas participants from the control group tended to be more undecided. Moreover, the VR system gave the participants the opportunity to enter the students' virtual body and understand the different perspectives affecting at a higher level the reflection process than the control group.

AB  - Recent research indicates that a majority of post-secondary students in North America "felt overwhelming anxiety" in the past few years, an effect that is negatively impacting their academic performance and overall well-being. Building on recent technology and cognitive priming research, we propose a theoretical framework and technology solution to address the student anxiety challenge using technology-based priming. As an initial test of our theoretical framework, this study aims to test the effectiveness of Virtual Reality gaming applications to reduce anxiety and increase cognitive bandwidth. In this preliminary, within-subjects study design, N=10, the primed participants showed a marked increase in cognitive test performance subsequent to the priming activity compared to the non-primed test session. The results also showed that highly anxious subjects derived more benefit from the priming activity than less anxious subjects.

AB  - While virtual reality (VR) is emerging as an interactive tool for chemical education, its application and assessment for chemical education are still limited. Thus, an educational VR activity based on interactive molecular dynamics in virtual reality (iMD-VR), which allows for realtime, immersive interactions with a dynamic molecular world, was now designed and executed to demonstrate chemical concepts and engage students in exploring molecular structures, motions, and interactions. There were 70 students in the first semester of an introductory organic chemistry course asked to complete an example task to pull a methane molecule through a carbon nanotube with iMD-VR software originally designed for research purposes by Glowacki and co-workers. Our assessments of this activity have shown valuable motivational impacts and measurable learning gains. The VR activity can be further tailored to many different levels by varying the topics and tasks, with affordable hardware and software.

TI  - Virtual Reality as a Teaching Tool for Moon Phases and Beyond
T2  - 2018 PHYSICS EDUCATION RESEARCH CONFERENCE (PERC)

CP  - Physics Education Research Conference (PERC)
AB  - A ball on a stick is a common and simple activity for teaching the phases of the Moon. This activity, like many others in physics and astronomy, gives students a perspective they otherwise could only imagine. For Moon phases, a third person view and control over time allows students to rapidly build a mental model that connects all the moving parts. Computer simulations of many traditional physics and astronomy activities provide new features, controls, or vantage points to enhance learning beyond a hands-on activity. Virtual reality provides the capabilities of computer simulations and embodied cognition experiences through a hands-on activity making it a natural step to improve learning. We recreated the traditional ball-and-stick moon phases activity in virtual reality and compared participant learning using this simulation with using traditional methods. We found a strong participant preference for VR relative to the traditional methods. However, we observed no difference across conditions in average levels of performance on a pre/post knowledge test.

AB  - This study examines the impact on engagement and affective outcomes of playful learning in social virtual reality (SVR) for distance and open education settings and aims to provide a practical framework for playful learning design. Three case studies in the United States and Greece were examined where playful learning was organized for e-learning. Data collection methods include questionnaires, observation of online course meetings, reviewing of course communications and chat logs records, student and instructor interviews, student coursework assessments, and reflections. Findings indicated that playful learning experiences in SVR can increase academic interest, intrinsic motivation, engagement level, satisfaction, and completion rates. Instructor genuine investment in a thoughtful, sophisticated humorous approach was vital for student buy-in. Finally, guiding principles for playful learning design in SVR are summarized in a model involving four dimensions: theme, actions, narrative, and auxiliary components (TANC).

AB  - Virtual Reality (VR) based approaches have emerged lately as a new learning and training paradigm. This paper addresses the possibility to cultivate teacher's reflection skills using a VR based approach targeting to maximize their professional development. Reflection has been considered as a skill of paramount importance for teachers and an integral part of their professional development. The research aimed to investigate possible difference in cultivating reflection skills between participants who used a VR system and the control group who participated in a real classroom setting. The results indicate that the process of reflection is essential for the participants of all groups. However, the participants using the virtual classroom environment scored higher to the reflective items that the control group that tended to be undecided. Moreover, the VR system gave the participants the opportunity to enter the students' virtual body and understand the different perspectives affecting at a higher level the reflection process than the control group.

AB  - An emerging issue in many physical education teacher education programs across the country is the limited pedagogical knowledge and hands on teaching experience of pre-service teachers going into any early clinical setting. Due to the lack of experience and knowledge, pre-service teachers may not be successful when given the opportunity to provide instruction. This in turn impacts their development and confidence as an instructor early in their career. Implementing a three-dimensional virtual reality experience to supplement an early field experience is a nontraditional way to approach the preparation of pre-service teachers.

AB  - In order to improve learning efficiency and memory retention in medical teaching, furthering active learning seems to be an effective alternative to classical teaching. One option to make active exploration of the subject matter possible is the use of virtual reality (VR) technology. The authors developed an immersive anatomy atlas which allows users to explore human anatomical structures interactively through virtual dissection. Thirty-two senior-class students from two German high schools with no prior formal medical training were separated into two groups and tasked with answering an anatomical questionnaire. One group used traditional anatomical textbooks and the other used the immersive virtual reality atlas. The time needed to answer the questions was measured. Several weeks later, the participants answered a similar questionnaire with different anatomical questions in order to test memory retention. The VR group took significantly less time to answer the questionnaire, and participants from the VR group had significantly better results over both tests. Based on the results of this study, VR learning seems to be more efficient and to have better long-term effects for the study of anatomy. The reason for that could lie in the VR environment's high immersion, and the possibility to freely and interactively explore a realistic representation of human anatomy. Immersive VR technology offers many possibilities for medical teaching and training, especially as a support for cadaver dissection courses.

AB  - This study investigates the role that textbooks, virtual reality (VR), and mixed approaches (i.e., text and VR) can play in the development of the two writing types, summary and argument writing. This study uses hemodynamics as a proxy for learning. Differences in hemodynamic responses during writing tasks were measured across four different pedagogical modalities: VR alone, VR followed by textbook readings, textbook readings followed by VR, and textbook readings alone. Adult students N = 80, recruited from non-science-based higher education programs, responded to two prompts related to content found in the VR environment and discussed in the textbook. The authors hypothesized that exposure to a virtual marine environment prior to writing would enhance the two writing products, when compared with participants who only had access to textbook experiences. Of the four conditions participants exposed to the VR environment then a textbook demonstrated significantly greater hemodynamic response than those who had access to VR alone or text alone.

AB  - Based on the demand for VR talents in today's society, virtual reality technology courses are offered in colleges and universities. This paper explores the construction idea of virtual reality course as one of innovation and entrepreneurship courses, and carries out practical teaching. By introducing the mode of school-enterprise cooperation, we can achieve complementary advantages. In order to achieve the two course objectives of VR technology training and innovation and entrepreneurship awareness training, the course is driven by innovation project development and technology learning, which is set up in four stages: project establishment and technology popularization stage, practical case training stage, independent project development stage, results release and inspection stage, and highlights group system, guidance system and acceptance system as course characteristics. In particular, in the stage of independent project development, the orientation system has been innovated, from students' free proposition to publishing Enterprise-level Project themes and needs, to enhance the integrity and interaction of student projects, and to improve the quality, significance and competitiveness of completed projects.

AB  - Research on immersive learning in natural setting such as schools, especially with/in virtual reality (VR), is only just emerging. While current inquiry concentrates on measuring content and procedural knowledge acquisition and to a lesser extent attitudinal change associated with exposure to VR applications, scant attention has been paid to what learners actually do in immersive virtual environments. This includes on- and off-task behavior, higher order thinking, and regulation of learning related to self and others. This methodological paper describes the use of screen capture video as a means of recording and analysing these types of learning behaviors in virtual environments with junior high school students. The paper outlines barriers, limitations and benefits to using screen capture video and the types of inductive and deductive analysis conducted as part of the research. It concludes that screen capture video is a promising medium for understanding verbal and non-verbal learning behavior as it actually unfolds in immersive VR.

AB  - Feedback plays a central role in learning. Crucial to this is the nature and timing of the feedback. This experimental study explores the efficacy of immediate computer-mediated feedback within a virtual reality environment designed to facilitate the development of pre-university students' presentation skills. Two conditions were established to assess the efficacy: immediate computer-mediated feedback; a control condition of delayed expert-mediated feedback. Results showed improvement but no statistically relevant difference in performance gains between the two conditions, suggesting both can facilitate learning. Furthermore, students perceived the environment to be an effective and motivating platform in which to practise presentation skills. For educators seeking viable alternatives to face-to-face presentation practice and feedback, the finding that immediate computer-mediated feedback is potentially as effective in aiding presentation performance is crucial for two reasons: first, it expands practice opportunities for students; second, it could result in less pressure on resources, including time and staffing.

AB  - Presence is a psychological phenomenon, the sense of being in a virtual environment. Experiencing presence is not limited to the users of full immersive virtual realities, but it can be experienced also in desktop virtual realities. These VRs visualize the simulated 3D environment on two-dimensional displays. MaxWhere is a desktop virtual environment for education, learning and working. It can be described as a 3D browser because any web-page could be loaded on the predefined SmartBoards of the virtual space. Already many research has been done on the use of this software, but this is the first time when the sense of presence is considered. The study aimed to measure the sense of presence in MaxWhere virtual reality and investigate its relationship with individual navigational experience and prior knowledge of the VR. Navigational experience is how much the user feels natural and automatic the movements in the virtual space. The results showed that better navigational experience correlates with stronger sense of spatial presence. Furthermore, the more experienced users reported higher sense of presence and gave higher rating on experienced realism subscale.

AB  - Virtual reality (VR) technology provides new possibilities for educators to design and optimize learning experiences. However, it remains largely unclear how virtual learning environments can be engineered to achieve measurable improvements in the learners' performance. To advance the development and application of VR learning technologies, we systematized instruction principles from the literature known to be congruent with cognitive and affective learning outcomes. We then combined these principles and designed a VR training program, which we subsequently tested in a large first-person VR experiment and real-world application to understand behavioral performance effects. In this article, we found that a purposefully engineered VR environment, which had been designed with an evidence-based selection of instruction principles, significantly improved the human performance compared to both a baseline training with textual instructions and a basic VR training. Our results indicate that perception engineering learning with VR is possible and offers substantial opportunities to improve learning outcomes.

AB  - Virtual Reality has been one of the interesting topics that have risen in the previous years. It has diverged into many fields including medicine, tourism, and education. On the other hand, new techniques have been used for teaching programming rather than the traditional paper and pen technique. The work presented in this paper proposes a new way of teaching children programming using the Virtual Reality (VR) technology. A game has been implemented with Scratch-like background to test whether the immersive factor of VR would have a positive effect on the learning outcome of the children. A study has been conducted on 10 participants to compare between two techniques for teaching the basic programming concepts: VR game and Desktop game. Results showed that the mean of the learning gain of the VR group was higher than the Desktop mean but with no significant p-value. However, the engagement test results showed that the participants were more engaged to the VR game than the Desktop game with p-value of 0.032.

AB  - Stereoscopic virtual reality (VR) has experienced a resurgence due to flagship products such as the Oculus Rift, HTC Vive and smartphone-based VR solutions like Google Cardboard. This is causing the question to resurface: how can stereoscopic VR be useful in instruction, if at all, and what are the pedagogical best practices for its use? To address this, and to continue our work in this sphere, we performed a study of 289 introductory physics students who were sorted into three different treatment types: stereoscopic virtual reality, WebGL simulation, and static 2D images, each designed to provide information about magnetic fields and forces. Students were assessed using preliminary items designed to focus on heavily-3D systems. We report on assessment reliability, and on student performance. Overall, we find that students who used VR did not significantly outperform students using other treatment types. There were significant differences between sexes, as other studies have noted. Dependence on students' self-reported 3D videogame play was observed, in keeping with previous studies, but this dependence was not restricted to the VR treatment.

AB  - We propose that (a) certain aspects of virtual reality (VR) training programs are seductive details, (b) these seductive details prompt trainee distraction and/or cognitive overload, and (c) pre-training interventions can benefit learning from VR training programs by targeting these mechanisms. In Study 1, we apply a meta-cognitive strategy pre-training intervention, which targets distraction, and a habituation pre-training intervention, which targets cognitive overload. Habituation had no effect, whereas meta-cognitive strategies worsened learning. Qualitative results indicated the meta-cognitive strategy intervention prompted trainees to become more cognitively engaged in the distracting seductive details of the VR training program. In Study 2, we tested an alternative pre-training intervention, attentional advice, to reduce distraction and increase learning. The attentional advice pre-training intervention was successful, as trainees demonstrated greater learning when provided attentional advice. Together, all proposals were supported. VR can contain seductive details that cause distraction, and attentional advice can improve learning by reducing distraction.

AB  - New generations of International Business (IB) students include the Centennials, also known as Generation Z. These students have experienced their whole life in a virtual and physical reality. They learn differently than previous generations and have an even shorter span of attention than Millennials. We - IB educators - need to acknowledge these changes in students, and propose new educational solutions that keep on preparing them to succeed in the international arena. In this paper, we suggest Virtual Reality (VR) as an innovative, cheaper and effective alternative solution to make IB students practice competencies. Based on Experiential Learning Theory, Social Cognitive Theory and Generational Theory, we offer ideas of several VR applications in the field. As an example, we describe an ongoing VR project using avatars to make students practice negotiation and intercultural communication. We report its preliminary findings. Paper ends with a discussion on VR teaching implications. Today, when multinational organizations are increasing the use of state-of-the-art technologies, initiatives like this can contribute to make IB students to exercise digital competencies too.

AB  - Virtual reality (VR) technology is playing a crucial role in the changing paradigm of education. In many cases, however, VR technology is not being taught because of the lack of relevant educational content at middle and high school levels. This study investigates the effect of design education using VR-based coding on students' competence and educational satisfaction in Korea. To develop a design education program using VR-based coding, examples of VR application and coding education were analyzed. Based on this analysis, we developed 2 design education programs for middle and high school students with the Korean school curriculum in mind. The program was taught to a sample of 301 students for six weeks. Following the implementation of the program, we conducted a satisfaction survey, and the correlation between the competence of middle and high school students and their educational satisfaction was statistically analyzed. The results showed that scientific competence exerts the greatest effect on students' overall educational satisfaction, followed by common competence, core competence, and information competence. Operational satisfaction was most affected by information competence, followed by core competence, common competence, and scientific competence. Core competence and information competence had a similar effect on levels of satisfaction with the educational environment. The developed program showed the potential to cultivate student competence and demonstrated that virtual reality-based coding is meaningful to design education. By understanding the competences that can exert a positive effect on satisfaction, this study is expected to provide effective baseline data for planning future curricula.

AB  - Anatomy education has been revolutionized through digital media, resulting in major advances in realism, portability, scalability, and user satisfaction. However, while such approaches may well be more portable, realistic, or satisfying than traditional photographic presentations, it is less clear that they have any superiority in terms of student learning. In this study, it was hypothesized that virtual and mixed reality presentations of pelvic anatomy will have an advantage over two-dimensional (2D) presentations and perform approximately equal to physical models and that this advantage over 2D presentations will be reduced when stereopsis is decreased by covering the non-dominant eye. Groups of 20 undergraduate students learned pelvic anatomy under seven conditions: physical model with and without stereo vision, mixed reality with and without stereo vision, virtual reality with and without stereo vision, and key views on a computer monitor. All were tested with a cadaveric pelvis and a 15-item, short-answer recognition test. Compared to the key views, the physical model had a 70% increase in accuracy in structure identification; the virtual reality a 25% increase, and the mixed reality a non-significant 2.5% change. Blocking stereopsis reduced performance on the physical model by 15%, on virtual reality by 60%, but by only 2.5% on the mixed reality technology. The data show that virtual and mixed reality technologies tested are inferior to physical models and that true stereopsis is critical in learning anatomy.

AB  - Despite their support in contemporary specifications for web-based virtual, augmented and mixed reality, such as WebXR, user interaction is limited in several ways in corresponding web applications. This paper introduces software components providing solution for two of these limitations: a lack of six degrees of freedom motion capturing for smartphone-based VR headsets and no hand gesture support for MS HoloLens. The components have been developed for LIRKIS Global - Collaborative Virtual Environments, but can be used for any web applications utilizing the A-Frame framework. The paper describes both components and evaluates their performance.

AB  - A deeper understanding of creativity and design is essential for the development of tools to improve designers' creative processes and drive future innovation. The objective of this research is to evaluate the effect of physical activity versus movement in a virtual environment on the creative output of industrial design students. This study contributes a novel assessment of whether the use of virtual reality can produce the same creative output within designers as physical activity has been shown to produce in prior studies. Eighteen industrial design students at the Georgia Institute of Technology completed nine design tasks across three conditions in a within-subjects experimental design. In each condition, participants independently experienced one of three interventions. Solutions were scored for novelty and feasibility, and self-reported mood data was correlated with performance. No significant differences were found in novelty or feasibility of solutions across the conditions. However, there are statistically significant correlations between mood, interventions, and peak performance to be discussed. The results show that participants who experienced movement in virtual reality prior to problem solving performed at an equal or higher level than physical walking for all design tasks and all designer moods. This serves as motivation for continuing to study how VR can provide an impact on a designer's creative output. Hypothesized creative performance with each mode is discussed using trends from four categories of mood, based on the combined mood characteristics of pleasantness (positive/negative) and activation (active/passive).

AB  - This study aims to explore a learner's embodiment and movements during discussion which are represented on an avatar in a social virtual reality (VR) space. From a user study, we demonstrated the validity of social VR space in an active learning (AL) setting. It is unclear whether such information represented on an avatar affects turn-taking and facilitates group discussion during AL activities. Therefore, this study conducted an experiment and clarified that turn-taking in the social VR space occurs more than on a monitor, leading to a better discussion.

AB  - With the rapid development of Internet technology, in consequence of the outbreak of COVID-19, colleges and universities have postponed the start of term, in order to protect the life safety of teachers and students. However, to avoid affecting students' academic studies, colleges and universities have taken various virtual reality technologies to implement personalized online teaching on students. However, there are still some problems in actual teaching, such as the monotonous teaching mode of animation course, which results in students' lack of practical animation operation ability; the lectures lay too much emphasis on the textbook content and the pedagogical knowledge in animation is not updated, etc. In our study, we will combine Animation Teaching mode with the educational concept of STEAM, and designs a teaching mode oriented to students' needs. This teaching mode include five parts: analysis of students' needs, analysis of learning goals, selection of learning strategies, design of learning activities and design of learning evaluation. At the same time, based on the American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) Model, our study will also investigate student satisfaction from four dimensions: student expectations, students' perceived quality, students' perceived value and student loyalty, with a view to measure the effectiveness of this teaching model. Through the teaching practice, it is found that this teaching mode can significantly promote students' grades and motivate their enthusiasm for learning. The students' autonomic learning and mastery of professional knowledge are significantly superior to those of traditional multimedia teaching method. The proposed teaching mode offers an objective reference for the application of virtual reality technology in teaching.

AB  - Educational technology plays an important role in the life of a medical student. The potential for virtual reality (VR) to enhance medical education has been discernible for more than 40 years; however, it has not been available due to the associated high costs [1]. With the advancement and affordability of three-dimensional (3D) technology, the introduction of virtual and augmented reality has the potential to change the way in which medical students learn today. Currently, teaching tools consist of a multitude of materials, from traditional resources such as books to more modern web-based videos, which provide students with extra study material in an effort to promote self-directed learning [2]. 3D learning objects have the potential to provide an alternative immersive learning tool for medical students to comprehend complex structures found within the medical education curricula [3], [4]. Furthermore, we can take this one step further by introducing 3D learning objects into virtual reality learning environments (VRLE's) [5]. VRLE's can assist in self-directed learning by providing an enhanced learning and understanding of invisible concepts, such as those found within the obstetrics and gynaecology curriculum. This study is based on the aforementioned concepts, which are used to develop an immersive 3D learning tool. This work-in-progress paper focuses on outlining the workflow process of the development of VR Baby, in which 3D learning objects are created for implementation into a VRLE, for future use within the medical education setting.

AB  - Due to their applications on varied and complex issues, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT) (collectively, AIoT) have become popular new-generation courses, but the learning of such courses needs to consider actual situations and to analyze complicated problems, making it difficult for students to improve their academic performance. The concept of computational thinking education is to allow students to find solutions to problems in different fields by understanding the problems and analyzing solution steps. In this study, we integrate the concept of computational thinking education into a course on plot image-based virtual reality (VR). It combined shooting of the actual field, instructions on the movie required to be shot, and VR in order to enable students to get immersed in thinking about problems and understanding the actual field through plot image-based VR, further plan to learn the essence of problems, and develop possible solutions. Through experimental results of experimental and control groups, we found that plot image-based VR can effectively improve students' interests in learning and computational thinking.

AB  - E-learning provides an individualized course path which provides a user the convenience of pacing ones way through a particular course. One of the key privileges it offers is the flexibility of the course and consistent delivery of the material. The proposed system predicts the user's domain knowledge with the help of the lectures knowledge that a particular user completes and also a lecture's knowledge gets updated with respect to the users' knowledge who searches for it. The dependency among the domains also plays a vital role in updating ones' domain knowledge. The dependencies can be determined by constructing a fuzzy cognitive map. This helps in determining the user's knowledge in other domains also. The lectures of the proposed system include Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality contents which give an interactive learning experience to the users. The user commands are accepted as audio signals, processed, classified and mapped to the system commands to make it to respond. This proposed work uses the combination of discrete wavelet transform and wavelet packet decomposition for feature extraction and artificial neural network for classification.

AB  - In recent years, virtual reality system (VRS) has become more prominent among many researchers due to its capacity of providing as close as possible to real-life experience for users from diverse fields of life, such as tourism, academics, manufacturing and medicine. In this study, we present an VRS for the titration experiment in a chemistry laboratory to enable students to learn the titration experiment in a virtual laboratory environment before proceeding to the chemistry wet lab. The virtual chemistry laboratory environment was developed using the Unity Real-Time Development Platform, and the Microsoft SQL Server was used for the database to enable easy assessment of the student performance after the experiment. To evaluate our VRS, we tested it among 50 students (25 high school and 25 first-year undergraduate chemistry students). We collate their user's experience through a structured questionnaire, and the responses from the students show that 60% agreed that it was helpful, 66% easy to interact with and 54% strongly agreed that it improved learning. Therefore, it is evidence that the proposed VR-enabled chemistry laboratory platform could be used to improve the understanding of chemistry titration practical process among students.

AB  - Objective Virtual reality (VR) objects of fetal ultrasound volumes have been proposed for teaching and learning diagnostic ultrasound. The aim of this study was to determine if VR objects improve learning efficiency and retention of diagnostic ability in fetal ultrasound.
   Methods Medical students and junior doctors were taught normal and abnormal sonographic fetal brain anatomy using conventional means (video lectures and review articles; control group) or additionally with selected VR objects from a novel fetal brain atlas (Pocket Brain, http://pb.fetal.ch; study group). Knowledge, speed of recognition and retention of diagnostic ability were tested in multiple-choice questionnaires 1 and 4 months after teaching, and the results were compared between those taught using conventional means only and those taught using VR objects.
   Results Participants taught using VR objects answered significantly more questions correctly and solved the tests quicker than those taught using conventional methods only, both 1 and 4 months after teaching.
   Conclusion The use of VR objects in teaching fetal ultrasound significantly improves learning efficiency and knowledge retention. Copyright (c) 2018 ISUOG. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Virtual Demonstrator provides a suite of tools for creating spatial presentations in VR, analogous to 2D slide-based presentation software. Within our software, Visual Elements are combined across a spatiotemporal space, with discrete states akin to presentation slides. This educational resource is designed to address a growing need to learn without physical presence, and to leverage 3D spaces for learning complex spatial concepts. A timeline expands a 3D environment into another dimension, allowing for an expanded design space.

AB  - Multivariable calculus is one of the core subjects which engineering students study at university. Students may end up memorizing formulae in multivariable calculus due to the lack of ability in visualizing 3D surfaces, and hence not gain much intuition for the subject. We developed an in-house virtual reality (VR) application with the intention for students to visualize concepts in Multivariable Calculus. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the VR application (which we term as the treatment), we performed a blinded randomized controlled trial with n = 312 students, where we divided them into a control group of n(CO) = 187 students and treatment group of n(TR) = 125 students. We gave both groups of students a test immediately after the treatment, as well as asking them to fill in anonymous survey questions using a Likert scale. Our findings show that students perform worse on some questions after using the VR application, and for some other questions students have similar performance to the treatment group. We hypothesize some reasons why this is so, opening the door for future research. We also give recommendations for future developers of VR applications.

AB  - An immersive virtual reality (iVR) game for high school students to learn about locations in their watershed with a primary focus on their city was designed and developed, employing a design model that focuses on flow. An exploratory study with the iVR game was conducted in an urban school in the eastern USA with 57 adolescents ages 16-18 from a population that is economically disadvantaged and includes students who are typically unengaged in traditional school-based learning environments. After game completion, the participants completed a 10-item survey measuring elements of flow and a 12-item survey designed to measure perceptions toward learning with VR games, immersion and presence. Participant focus groups were conducted with an emphasis on features that promoted engagement, learning, immersion, and presence. The findings revealed that all students experienced a flow state when they played the iVR learning game. Almost all users (98.1%) had positive attitudes towards using the iVR game. Students experienced high immersion and presence. In addition, students had favorable attitudes towards learning with iVR games in school environments.

AB  - With the recent advancements in digital technologies, the design studios are transformed to virtual environments that offer both to design students and instructors a broader perspective in understanding the design process. As an integral part of design process, the supporting virtual tools enhance creativity in basic design studios. This study examines the influence of immersive and non-immersive virtual design environments on design process creativity in the first year basic design studio, through observing the factors related to creativity as the flow state and motivation. Consequently, an experiment is conducted to investigate the relationships between spatial ability, flow state and motivation in immersive and non-immersive virtual design environments. Forty-two first-year undergraduate basic design students participated in the experiment. The data analysis demonstrated that the immersive virtual design environment facilitates participants' design process creativity more than the non-immersive one. Also, the findings indicated a positive strong correlation between motivations and flow state and a positive weak correlation between spatial ability and flow state. Study results contributed to a greater understanding of implementing immersive virtual reality as a creativity supporting tool.

AB  - Educational Environmental Narrative (EEN) games in Virtual Reality (VR) provide rich, highfidelity environments that provide a fully immersive and interactive storytelling experience for use in teaching. Yet, it is not fully known how learning experience is affected by freely exploring the environment (interaction mode) and having an explicit story structure. A randomized controlled 2 x 2 study with 42 adolescents was performed to correct this omission and find the effect that these two factors have on recalling important information and on how a player feels when playing a game. They explored an EEN VR game with different interaction modes (active vs passive) and story structures (explicit vs implicit) and then completed a knowledge test and standardized questionnaires, regarding their sense of presence, cognitive interest and engagement during the game. Results show that allowing players to navigate freely through the game has positive effects on cognitive interest and a feeling of presence. An implicitly structured game leads to increased recall of spatial information. However, for optimal learning of factual knowledge, guidance is beneficial.

AB  - Cells are central to the study of biology, yet many learners have difficulties understanding the abstract yet fundamental foundation of life. Research suggests that students' conceptions of cells are reinforced by current biology learning materials, which represent cells as two dimensional, highly ordered, and mostly empty. These models also inaccurately represent the number, location, and size of organelles. We examine the effect of an inquiry-based three-dimensional virtual reality (VR) game on high school students' mental models of cells. Students reported that the game was more interactive and engaging than traditional ways of learning about cells and attributed an improved understanding of cells to their game experience. Students' post drawings of cells depicted more types of organelles, increased density of organelles, and additional complexity than their pretest drawings, indicating a movement towards more accurate mental models of cells. However, students' scores did not improve on their factual knowledge about cells between the pretest and the post-game biology assessments. We discuss the implications of incorporating game-based approaches and new technologies such as VR into biology education.

AB  - The pandemic of COVID-19 has radically changed the anatomy education approaches. This happens because medical students, due to the necessity of remote education, didn't have access to cadavers, which was the principal method of dissection training. Circumstances like these encouraged the health care providers to innovate new teaching methods with the help of virtual and augmented reality to outdistance the restrictions. This review aims to examine the pioneer technological and educational tools and their usage in the future. Detailed research was performed via the PubMed database using the following keywords "Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), Anatomy Education, and COVID-19". No further filters were used. All the existing evidence suggests that the vast majority was negatively affected by the COVID-19 era. Using new technological methods in anatomy training could not effectively replace the absence of the traditionally used teaching methods like dissection, prosection, and lectures by physical presence. Although the new digital anatomy teaching approaches seem to be very promising, it is not clear if they can fully replace the traditional anatomy education methods.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate differences in students' situational interest (exploration intention, instant enjoyment, novelty, attention demand, challenge, and total interest) and cognitive load (intrinsic, extraneous, and germane) of VR-guide and map-guide groups in a university library. The VR-guide group used wearable spherical video-based virtual reality (SVVR) devices, while the map-guide group used tablets to learn the functions of the library. Both groups completed a prior knowledge test, field tasks, a situational interest scale, and a cognitive load scale. The results show that, in comparison with the use of the map-guide, the wearable VR-guide could yield a higher degree of "Novelty" and "Challenge" (in the situational interest dimension), as well as higher germane cognitive load. This study reveals that harnessing SVVR in learning and teaching has a positive impact on university students. The educational use of SVVR has good potential for transforming students' way of learning, improving traditional learning, and enhancing students' understanding of content and learning motivation.

AB  - The paper gives an overview of how virtual reality (VR) literature and related sources describe the notion of immersion, its sub-types and similar terms. There are two main schools giving definitions for immersion in VR, and their definitions are quite different. One school, associated with B. Witmer and M. Singer, regards immersion as a psychological state of the user. The other school, based on the works of M. Slater, sees immersion as an objective characteristic of a VR system. Some authors call the first type of immersion "psychological immersion" and the second type "technological immersion". The authors of the present paper bring up the possibility of using alternative terms: "immersedness" for the immersion concept of the first school, and, for that of the second school, "immersingness" (denoting the actively immersing quality of the system) and "immersing" when referring to the act of immersing the user. The term "immersedness" is unambiguous, contrary to the term "psychological immersion" which could also mean a system characteristic when the system is created with the ability to try to manipulate the user with psychological means.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the role textbooks can play on writing complexity and lexical density as a proxy for critical thinking and ultimately learning, in relation to argumentative and summative writing when integrated with a virtual reality experience. In this study, differences in writing complexity and lexical density scores were measured across four different pedagogical modalities: VR alone, VR followed by textbook readings, textbook readings followed by VR, and textbook readings alone. Adult students, recruited from non-science-based higher education programs, responded to two prompts related to content found in the VR environments and discussed in the textbooks. The authors hypothesized that exposure to a virtual marine environment prior to responding to the writing prompts would enhance both argumentative and summative writing products, when compared to participants who only had access to the textbook experiences. Participants who were exposed to the VR environment then a textbook demonstrated significantly greater writing complexity and lexical density scores than those who had access to VR alone, or access to the text alone.

AB  - The Covid-19 pandemic has caused major changes in many sectors of society worldwide. The issue of medical education stands out since it had to adapt to the rules of social isolation, ensuing discussions about the computerization of teaching methodology, particularly in neuroanatomy. In particular, the latter showed satisfactory adaptability to new technologies and highly promising learning results. During this review, we aim to evaluate the current state of neuroanatomy teaching and evaluate the possibilities of incorporating technology into teaching-learning of human anatomy in a post-pandemic world.

AB  - Learning objects are used in many knowledge areas and may be aligned with technologies such as stereoscopy and ultra-high definition, instigating interactions and arousing interest in educational environments. Generating such objects from real pieces is a challenge because it requires computational resources to maintain quality and fidelity. Another challenge is to port these objects to different devices such as immersive theater, cell phones, virtual reality glasses, and televisions/projectors. Hence, we developed a framework capable of generating learning objects from real pieces with quality and fidelity of form, color, and texture. This article focuses on the generation of learning objects for these devices.

AB  - Rapid proliferation of technology during the last two decades has resulted in major changes in the nature of work. Further, the networking and automation of processes in the era of Industry 4.0 have necessitated the deployment of machines to perform routine and repetitive tasks which were earlier being handled by humans. Process automation and computerization have not only resulted in the loss of various jobs, but have also created new jobs which are technology-oriented and require relevant skills. This change in the job scenario has placed a great stress on the engineering students at undergraduate level to learn new skills in order to ensure their employability. Apart from learning contemporary technologies, the students need to possess non-cognitive skills, which will help them to deliver the demands posed by the current job challenges. The paper studies the impact of learning one such technology - Virtual Reality, on enhancing the employability of undergraduate engineering students in India. A model is proposed in the study and is substantiated through analysis of primary data collected from undergraduate engineering students in India.

AB  - A 2X2 between-subjects experiment (a) investigated and compared the instructional effectiveness of immersive virtual reality (VR) versus video as media for teaching scientific procedural knowledge, and (b) examined the efficacy of enactment as a generative learning strategy in combination with the respective instructional media. A total of 117 high school students (74 females) were randomly distributed across four instructional groups - VR and enactment, video and enactment, only VR, and only video. Outcome measures included declarative knowledge, procedural knowledge, knowledge transfer, and subjective ratings of perceived enjoyment. Results indicated that there were no main effects or interactions for the outcomes of declarative knowledge or transfer. However, there was a significant interaction between media and method for the outcome of procedural knowledge with the VR and enactment group having the highest performance. Furthermore, media also seemed to have a significant effect on student perceived enjoyment, indicating that the groups enjoyed the VR simulation significantly more than the video. The results deepen our understanding of how we learn with immersive technology, as well as suggest important implications for implementing VR in schools.

AB  - In middle school biology teaching and learning, there are many biological structures that students need to understand and master. Traditional classrooms mostly use video and PPT to teach, which is not conducive to students' understanding of three-dimensional structure, thus making it difficult to learn biological knowledge. In order to solve the problem of 3D biological structure learning, this paper proposes a natural interaction-based VR biology learning system method, which intelligently perceives the user's interaction intention and interacts with the user through virtual reality technology and multi-modal fusion technology. The innovation of this paper lies in: Firstly, a new VR biological learning system based on natural interaction is proposed. Through the fusion of gestures and speech, the user interacts naturally with the system. This method frees the user's hands from the constraints of the mouse and keyboard and the handle, enhancing the immersion of virtual reality. Secondly, this paper proposes a multi-modal fusion algorithm, which makes full use of the advantages of gestures and speech and compensates for their shortcomings, so as to better perceive the user's operational intention. It makes up for the shortcomings of the virtual learning system's lack of intelligence, so that users get a more convenient and more natural interactive experience. According to the user's experience feedback, the system proposed in this paper can better stimulate students' interest in learning, and can present the abstract threedimensional knowledge in front of the user more intuitively. It has the good intelligence and the operation experience feeling, can reduce the user's use load effectively, the user operates more conveniently.

AB  - Virtual reality (VR) in science classrooms has the potential to enhance students' learning by bridging the knowledge in the learners' communities with science instruction. When virtual environments reflect students' culture, it has the potential to influence their attitudes toward the value of science in their community. This qualitative study examined student reflections on learning science using virtual reality software with embedded culturally relevant design elements. After learning how to use this technology, fifty-eight 4th and 5th grade students from urban schools in Northern California were interviewed about their experiences learning science. Students explained how learning science through virtual worlds influenced their perceptions of how science mattered in their lives. Students explained the influence of CRP-VR in impacting how they saw the value of science in their communities. Implications of this research highlight the need for educational stakeholders to consider the relevance of integrating culturally relevant perspectives in VR technologies. This approach has the potential to position learners and their communities as bearers of scientific knowledge and thus providing a more dynamic learning experience.

AB  - Virtual reality (VR) allows users to experience a virtual world in 3D by wearing a headset. This headset includes a screen and lenses to produce this effect. This study uses VR in a training context to test if the quality of preparation for laboratories in engineering education can be improved. A virtual version of a second-year engineering lab was created to teach students the fundamental concepts involved, such that they are more prepared for the real lab. Unity was used to create the application, Blender was used to model the equipment, and Substance Painter was used to texture the models. Engineering students were tested before and after training, and their learning improvement measured. These students were split into two sets; the first used the VR, the second used the traditional briefing sheet. All students also answered a questionnaire to reflect their feelings on their given system of work. Students consistently showed a better improvement and therefore understanding of the lab when using VR. It was also seen that students gave more positive answers for the VR than for the briefing sheet in the questionnaire.

AB  - Phenomenographic research about teachers' conception of teaching has consistently revealed that teachers' conception of teaching influence their classroom practices, which in turn shape students' learning experiences. This paper reports teachers' conceptions of teaching with regards to the use of interactive spherical video-based virtual reality (ISV-VR) in Chinese descriptive composition writing. Twenty-one secondary teachers in Hong Kong involved in an ISV-VR-supported Chinese descriptive writing program participated in this phenomenographic study. Analyses of the semi-structured interviews establish seven conception categories that are specifically related to the use of ISV-VR for descriptive Chinese composition writing: (1) offering students more observational opportunities; (2) improving students' writing skills; (3) promoting students' learning participation and motivation; (4) shifting learning from teacher-centric to student-centric, (5) enhancing collaborative learning among students; (6) cultivating students' positive values and moral character, and (7) shaping students' self-identity as "writers." The concurrent and convenient access to the ISV-VR resources was for the teachers an enriched and supportive environment for them to cultivate students' writer identity. In addition, it was discovered that the structural relationships of the conceptions may be better organized along three axes of continuum: conception's orientation, teaching attention locus, and understanding of writing. These categories form a hierarchy from skill-oriented to community-oriented, and finally to identity-oriented conception. The findings may provide researchers and practitioners with novel insight into the teaching of composition writing in the contexts of L1 acquisition supported by virtual reality technology.

AB  - Virtual reality (VR) technology has been capturing the public imagination for decades. VR software applications that allow for interactive immersion are emerging as a renowned medium in many areas, including educating the public in biochemistry-related subjects via public engagement events. This report provides information about an immersive, interactive and educational virtual reality (VR) game named Bug Off Pain that increases scientific literacy about chronic pain and spider venoms among the public and high school students. Here, VR was shown to be an innovative and fun approach to learning and public engagement in biochemistry. Bug Off Pain places the viewer inside the brain and shows the molecular system that allows people to sense pain. After securing three (learning) points via the multimedia-based clips, this experience translates to the interactive game. Here, a player has to choose a venom that shuts down the pain until that results in "pain over". Bug Off Pain can be played (free of charge) on two different VR platforms: Oculus Rift and Android devices.

AB  - This study developed a peer assessment approach incorporated into virtual reality (VR) design activities for fifth-grade students to learn knowledge about a geological park in their natural science course. All the students were asked to design a VR project after they had learned the geological knowledge, so as to raise their environmental awareness and cultivate their earth science knowledge. In order to evaluate the learning performance and perceptions of students in two groups, one with peer assessment and the other with teacher feedback, we collected the learning achievements, learning motivation, self-efficacy, critical thinking tendency, creativity tendency, and cognitive load of learners before and after the activities. The results indicated that students performing the VR design activity with the peer assessment learning approach had higher learning effectiveness. They also had higher self-efficacy and critical thinking tendencies than those using the VR design system with conventional teacher feedback. In other words, the peer assessment approach not only improves students' learning achievement, but also enhances their self-efficacy and critical thinking tendencies.

AB  - Learning style is the endogenous cause of students' unique behaviors when they are performing learning tasks. The adaptive learning system that considers learning style can provide a personalized experience to stimulate students' enthusiasm, which had been widely studied in recent years. However, most of such existing systems are constructed based on a desktop environment, which leads to the less-than-ideal effect of personalized learning due to the limitation of interaction means and environmental dimension. Therefore, an adaptive virtual reality learning method based on the learning style model was proposed in this study. This method continuously iterated the identification of learning style based on students' subjective and objective data. Then, the content of virtual learning environment was sustainedly adjusted according to the identification results, thus enabling the environment to dynamically adapt to students' learning styles. To evaluate the feasibility of this proposed method, a controlled experiment on 152 participants was conducted. Results show that this method obtained relatively stable and accurate results of learning style identification, with an accuracy range of 74.38%-80.30%. Moreover, learning in the virtual environment constructed based on this method had a positive impact on students' learning motivation and outcomes.

AB  - The flow experience-performance link is commonly found weak in virtual environments (VEs). The weak association model (WAM) suggests that distraction caused by disjointed features may be associated with the weak association. People characterized by field independent (FI) or field dependent (FD) cognitive style have different abilities in handling sustained attention, thus they may perform differently in the flow-performance link. To explore the role of the field dependence-independence (FDI) construct on the flowperformance link in virtual reality (VR), we developed a VR experimental environment, based on which two empirical studies were performed. Study 1 revealed FD individuals have higher dispersion degree of fixations and showed a weaker flow-performance link. Next, we provide visual cues that utilize distractors to achieve more task-oriented attention. Study 2 found it helps strengthen the task performance, as well as the flow-performance link of FD individuals without increasing distraction. This paper helps draw conclusions on the effects of human diversity on the flow-performance link in VEs and found ways to design a VR system according to individual characteristics.

AB  - Virtual reality (VR) has a high potential to facilitate education. However, the design of many VR learning applications was criticized for lacking the guidance of explicit and appropriate learning theories. To advance the use of VR in effective instruction, this study proposed a model that extended the cognitive-affective theory of learning with media (CATLM) into a VR learning context and evaluated this model using a structural equation modeling (SEM) approach. Undergraduate students (n = 77) learned about the solar system in a VR environment over three sessions. Overall, the results supported the core principles and assumptions of CATLM in a VR context (CATLM-VR). In addition, the CATLM-VR model illustrated how immersive VR may impact learning. Specifically, immersion had an overall positive impact on user experience and motivation. However, the impact of immersion on cognitive load was uncertain, and that uncertainty made the final learning outcomes less predictable. Enhancing students' motivation and cognitive engagement may more directly increase learning achievement than increasing the level of immersion and may be more universally applicable in VR instruction.

AB  - Simulations, serious games, and virtual reality (SSG) applications represent promising support for achieving practical proficiency, but it is difficult to know how to introduce them into a new environment. This paper aims to contribute to a better understanding of introducing new SSGs to a non-computer related educational environment-biomedical laboratory science (BLS) education. By following the choice, construction, and evaluation of a gamified app for practicing phlebotomy (StikkApp), not only the usefulness of the application, but also the general needs and possibilities for supporting SSG applications, are discussed. This paper presents the evaluation of StikkApp through an experimental study examining its use on mobile devices, as a web app and by discussing challenges for a corresponding virtual reality app by BLS students and their teachers. This evaluation focused on questions concerning usage scenarios, technologies, and how the design of the app can be aligned to learning goals necessary for education. By discussing these requirements and possibilities for apps and technology support for using SSG apps for BLS students, this paper contributes to a better understanding of using digital support for sustainable education.

AB  - Educational fields that are abstract in nature, such as computer science (CS) and other science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields may find alternative teaching methods useful to maximize student opportunities to internalize and process the curriculum. When designing alternative educational tools in virtual reality (VR) technologies the objective is to expose an academically diverse population to CS in an engaging and immersive environment. With this objective in mind, we built and tested a CS educational VR experience. CSpressso, designed to teach students to count in a binary (base-2) number system. Testing confirmed that the student group who learned to count binary in VR were just as successful as those who learned from a certified CS instructor. This shows that VR educational experiences can be used as alternative teaching tools in CS education, which can supplement traditional teaching methods enabling new learning methods for students in the classroom and at home. We believe that this is evidence to support a larger effort in adapting the current CS education system to meet the needs of a more diverse student body that may find alternative teaching tools useful in internalizing abstract concepts.

AB  - Rapid advances in the quality and accessibility of immersive virtual reality (IVR) have brought about intense interest in applications of the technology within higher education, including STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) teaching and learning. However, evidence is mixed on the effectiveness of IVR for STEM teaching and learning, and there are currently few models of how best to incorporate these activities into typical STEM courses. We created a sequence of IVR activities for teaching concepts in organic chemistry and carried out an experimental investigation on the impacts of these on student performance, with special focus on student characteristics including first-generation college student status, gender, and ethnicity. Two sections of Organic Chemistry were compared; in one randomly assigned section, students had the option of completing these IVR activities, and in the other, they did not. Results showed a trend towards improved course grades and final exam scores in the section offered IVR activities, particularly for first-generation college students. These findings suggest that IVR can be a practical and effective way to reinforce learning and student success in realistic university STEM settings, especially for certain demographic subgroups.

AB  - The current trends in education for distance and personalized learning, calls for further investigation on the educational benefits of a Virtual Reality (VR) software, regarding laboratory science courses. In this study, we investigated the teaching effectiveness of a VR-oriented innovative method vs a more traditional pedagogical approach, by measuring the Pre-Post change, commonly called as Learning Gain (LG). An Item Response Theory model, The Rasch Model (RM), was used to assess the LG as the difference between the students' ability before and after the educational treatment. The participants, (N = 54) graduate students enrolled in the Department of Primary Education, at the University of Patras, in Greece, were divided into two groups and followed two different scenarios to be educated on the topic of microscopy. Our findings provided evidence in favor of using simulations as a supplementary tool to the learning procedure. According to the LG analysis, the students that interacted with the VR software showed a higher change in ability, compared to their fellow students, who followed a more classic teaching methodology and obtained no LG between the Pre and Posttesting situation.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has posed a challenge for many medical schools, as they have had to adjust their curricula into an online format. This was particularly problematic for anatomy courses as in person dissections have historically been preferred for providing students with a three-dimensional learning environment. In this study, we aim to share our experience with conducting anatomy lectures for medical student using a virtual reality (VR) workspace. Additionally, we discuss the advantages of using VR and expand on how it may be used to improve students' understanding of anatomy in comparison to various other online lecture formats. To do this, we utilized a post-lecture survey to gain feedback from the medical students that participated in a VR anatomy workspace. We found that many of our participants expressed that having access to their course material from anywhere and anytime via a virtual space, and being able to manipulate anatomical structures by moving and modifying them provided the student with a strong advantage. Although there are still limitations, we hope that our experience will assist other anatomy teachers with improving their lecture methods, especially during the pandemic.

AB  - The term Metaverse ("meta" defined as beyond, transcendence or virtuality, and "verse" meaning universe or world) denotes a "virtual reality space" for anatomy teaching. To ascertain how many anatomists are familiar or are using this adjunct in teaching, we conducted a short survey at the 2022 annual meeting of the American Association of Clinical Anatomists (AACA). Interestingly, only six respondents (9.4%) had used a Metaverse for teaching anatomy. Moreover, the vast majority of attendees were anatomy educators or basic science faculty, but not practicing physicians/surgeons or other actively practicing health care professionals; a group where this technology has been used much more commonly. The present manuscript was authored by anatomy educators, practicing physicians and other actively practicing health care professionals with backgrounds in diverse medical fields, that is, anatomists, medical doctors, physician assistants, dentists, occupational therapists, physical therapists, chiropractors, veterinarians, and medical students. Many of these authors have used or have been exposed to a Metaverse in the clinical realm. Therefore, the aim of the paper is to better understand those who are knowledgeable of a Metaverse and its use in anatomy education, and to provide ways forward for using such technology in this discipline.

AB  - Problem-based learning (PBL) is a type of student-centred educational approach where students learn a topic via their experience in solving open-ended problems. In PBL, elements of active, interactive, and collaborative learning are incorporated to allow teachers to observe their students' learning process. The contexts of problems in PBL are in the form of cases and narratives of the real world where there are no right or wrong answers. Virtual reality (VR) is a part of mixed reality where a real-world environment is made to be virtual online. In VR, real-world elements are rendered as 3D objects. By adopting VR technologies in PBL, this will enable teachers to form virtual world narratives and cases akin to problems in a real world. VR allows elements of active, interactive, and collaborative to be integrated in students' learning process. This study explores how VR may be adopted to enable PBL and improve group work skill as well as self-directed learning. The gained research results indicated that PBL with the presentation problem scenario in VR environment is effective in enhancing the group work skills and self-directed learning among students.

AB  - Children are increasingly exposed to virtual reality (VR) technology as end-users. However, they miss an opportunity to become active creators due to the barrier of insufficient technical background. Creating scenes in VR requires considerable programming knowledge and excludes non-tech-savvy users, e.g., school children. In this paper, we showcase a system called VRtangibles, which combines tangible objects and touch input to create virtual scenes without programming. With VRtangibles, we aim to engage children in the active creation of virtual scenes via playful hands-on activities. From the lab study with six school children, we discovered that the majority of children were successful in creating virtual scenes using VRtangibles and found it engaging and fun to use.

AB  - Students studying pharmacy often lack motivation to engage with chemical principles. In particular, they often find fundamental chemical concepts such as the visualisation of three-dimensional structures challenging. This programme description reports the design and implementation of a teaching session where stand-alone virtual reality (VR) technology was offered alongside traditional methods of instruction in an attempt to encourage students to engage with fundamental chemistry concepts relating to the three-dimensional structures of drug molecules. By using VR technology in combination with paper-based in-class exercises and supporting material delivered via a virtual learning environment, the authors demonstrate that virtual reality could be used to both reinforce learning and enhance engagement with a topic which students often find challenging. A blended approach employing different methods of delivery presents the advantage that it allows the user control over the level of interaction with each individual element. As such, VR becomes a valuable instructional tool rather then the focus of the session or a distraction. To evaluate the sessions, student feedback was collected using a 'ballot-box' system where students could provide anonymous free response comments. Feedback from the session was overwhelmingly positive and it was noted that the optional use of VR technology kept students engaged in tackling paper-based exercises in an area of curriculum which learners often find difficult. It is noted that a blended approach can help to overcome several of the barriers in the use of VR in a classroom setting. In addition, it highlights that effective deployment of such technology is both viable and beneficial on a classroom scale. In the future, the authors hope to apply these methods to other parts of the curriculum

AB  - BackgroundThe use of virtual reality (VR) in medical education allows learners to make mistakes safely without risk to patients and to refine a range of clinical skills by repetition. However, there is still wide variability both between, and within countries regarding the amount of training delivered using VR, particularly in relation to intensive care medicine ObjectivesTo identify the range of uses, phase of development and effectiveness of VR for intensive care unit (ICU) staff training. MethodsThe review followed the scoping review framework set out by Levac et al. (2010). A multi-database search was undertaken. All study types were included if they explored the use of VR for intensive care staff (ICU) staff training. Full paper screening, data extraction and assessment of bias was carried out by a single reviewer with verification by a second reviewer. A narrative synthesis was chosen to summarize the data. ResultsThe search strategy identified 647 records. Following the removal of duplicates, screening of titles, abstracts and full texts, five studies were included. VR for ICU training has primarily focused on skill acquisition for surgical procedures. The majority of studies in this area were classified to be at an early stage of assessing acceptability, tolerability and efficacy. There was very low-quality evidence that VR for ICU training is effective. ConclusionsStudies have explored the use of VR for a small number of surgical procedures and emergency patient scenarios. VR for ICU training demonstrates some potential, however further development and high-quality research is required. Research relating to virtual reality for ICU staff training is currently of weak methodological quality and as such, no recommendations to clinical practise can be made. Wherever possible when using VR for ICU staff training it should be utilized as part of a high-quality study.

AB  - With the development of modern technologies such as virtual reality, new diseases and ailments have also begun to appear.
   One of them is the so-called virtual disease, also known as simulator disease. Its effects are similar to motion sickness. It is manifested by eye pain, headache and dizziness. It occurs in some people after a session with virtual reality. The authors dealt with the study of immersion in the virtual world and noticed that some of the subjects felt discomfort. It appeared during or after a session of VR. Such people are the focus of this article. By carefully analysing biophysical data, experience in VR sessions and questionnaire replies, the authors try to determine what could have been the cause of such ill-being.
   A research group was formed, which included not only employees of the Lublin University of Technology but also students. Together, both the research environment (multimedia application) as well as research scenarios were developed.
   Participants of the research were asked to complete two surveys. By means of the first questionnaire carried out prior to the test, profiles of subjects were created, the second survey carried out after the research was to check whether symptoms of virtual disease were present. The duration of the test was 10 minutes, if the symptoms of the virtual disease increased, the test was stopped. The test consisted of placing the participant in a virtual reality in which simulated moving around a virtual island with uneven terrain and surrounded by water, the participant had complete control of navigation in virtual reality. The study was attended by 40 people, each person was examined two times, once in a sitting position and once in a standing position, the interval between the researches of a given person was one hour.
   From the obtained research results, the relationships between the incidence of virtual disease and physical factors of participants were noted. The higher probability of the occurrence of a virtual disease was noticed in women, in people with sight defects as well as in people suffering from motion sickness. In addition, differences in the frequency of occurrence of the virtual disease were noted depending on the posture of the examined person (standing and sitting) as well as the platform they were using. The tests were carried out using both Oculus Rift DK2 and a VR phone. In addition, an original multimedia interactive application written in Unity was used.]

AB  - In this article, I examine perspective taking in virtual reality (VR) representations of the past, which could be regarded as one of the latest developments in the genre of reenactment and affective history. By building on Vanessa Agnew's analysis of reenactment, I argue that some VR experiences, even though they reduce the distance between the knower and the known and adopt a strong emphasis on emotional engagement, can contribute to historical understanding and promote coming to terms with the past. I emphasize the importance of recognizing how VR experiences situate the audience and the past in relation to each other, i.e., through modes of relation that entail projection, replication, rupture and dialogical attention to the past. These modes of relation are configured through devices of proximity and distance, the combination of which produces a unique approach to the past in each VR experience. By analyzing two VR experiences - The Book of Distance and Accused #2: Walter Sisulu - I demonstrate how they put the tension between distance and proximity in relation to the past on display. The Book of Distance, in particular, makes distance, rather than proximity, much more prominent in its narration, while Accused #2 shifts the focus to the auditory experience, thereby emphasizing the speculative nature of the visual aspect of historical imagination.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of immersive three-dimensional (3D) interactive virtual reality (VR) on anatomy training in undergraduate physical therapy students. A total of 72 students were included in the study. The students were randomized into control (n = 36) and VR (n = 36) group according to the Kolb Learning Style Inventory, sex, and Purdue Spatial Visualization Test Rotations (PSVT-R). Each student completed a pre-intervention and post-intervention test, consisting of 15 multiple-choice questions. There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of age, sex, Kolb Learning Style Inventory distribution, and the PSVT-R (P > 0.05). The post-test scores were significantly higher compared to pre-test scores in both the VR group (P < 0.001) and the control group (P < 0.001). The difference between the pre-test and post-test results was found to be significantly higher in favor of the VR group (P < 0.001). In this study, anatomy training with a 3D immersive VR system was found to be beneficial. These results suggest that VR systems can be used as an alternative method to the conventional anatomy training approach for health students.

AB  - Virtual reality (VR) and game-based learning strategies have rarely been investigated together with a keen focus on motivational processing. This lack of understanding on motivational support of VR game-based learning has hindered the design of such environments to effectively and efficiently support intended learning processes. The study revealed relationships between learners' motivational processing and perceived game features in a VR learning environment for delivering introductory archaeology content to college students. The first part of the study adopted the complementary concurrent mixed-method design, which applied qualitative results to clarify quantitative findings to delineate motivational support perceived by 40 participants. The second part employed quantitative survey data only from the same sample to reveal perceived game features and relationships between motivational support and game features. Findings suggest that learners' motivational processing was supported by the Confidence and Satisfaction components of the ARCS motivational design model. Additionally, not all motivational components were supported by perceived game features according to multiple regression analyses. The discussion of the findings is focused on in what areas and to what extent multimedia-rich VR elements might compete with game-based learning in the same learning environment for learners' limited cognitive and behavioral learning capacities.

AB  - Student teachers often struggle to keep track of everything that is happening in the classroom, and particularly to notice and respond when students cause disruptions. The complexity of the classroom environment is a potential contributing factor that has not been empirically tested. In this experimental study, we utilized a virtual reality (VR) classroom to examine whether classroom complexity affects the likelihood of student teachers noticing disruptions and how they react after noticing. Classroom complexity was operationalized as the number of disruptions and the existence of overlapping disruptions (multidimensionality) as well as the existence of parallel teaching tasks (simultaneity). Results showed that student teachers (n = 50) were less likely to notice the scripted disruptions, and also less likely to respond to the disruptions in a comprehensive and effortful manner when facing greater complexity. These results may have implications for both teacher training and the design of VR for training or research purpose. This study contributes to the field from two aspects: 1) it revealed how features of the classroom environment can affect student teachers' noticing of and reaction to disruptions; and 2) it extends the functionality of the VR environment-from a teacher training tool to a testbed of fundamental classroom processes that are difficult to manipulate in real-life.

AB  - Nowadays, the use of digital games for educational purposes becomes increasingly popular. The immersive environment of a digital game causes pleasant feelings to players motivating them to participate more actively in the learning process. However, there is a variety of educational games in terms of graphics and mechanics, and each player prefers to play different game categories. For maximizing the learner's engagement and educational results, the incorporation of the same educational content into multiple games' categories is the solution. Nevertheless, the update of the educational content in all games increases complexity. In this paper, a mechanism that uses web services and achieves the portability of the same educational content in two completely different categories of mobile games (a point-and-click game and a virtual reality game) is presented. The gain of this innovative work is that the same educational content and mechanism can be accessible by any game's category and platform, taking advantage of the game's characteristics, in order to motivate the student to participate in the learning process and increase her/his engagement in it. The evaluation of the presented system indicates that the integration of the same educational content to different games has a positive effect on educational results.

AB  - In recent years, several researchers have introduced spherical video-based virtual reality (SVVR) into classroom teaching to help students learn different subjects. In SVVR learning, learners are typically presented with great autonomy over their learning process. Therefore, learners should engage in self-regulated strategy (SRS) learning in order to successfully study in SVVR. However, learners often struggle to self-regulate their learning. Therefore, we implemented a SRS intervention in SVVR. In this study, a SVVR environment was developed to situate students in art history contexts; moreover, the SRS was employed to guide students to improve their performance and to make reflections on their own performance. In order to evaluate the proposed approach's effectiveness, we carried out an experiment in a university art history class. The experiment results reveal more positive effects of the SRS-based SVVR approach compared with the non-SRS-based SVVR approach in terms of the learners' learning achievements, self-regulation, meta-cognitive awareness, as well as self-efficacy. In addition, this study specified that this approach would not have an effect on students' cognitive load. As a result, the SRS-based SVVR approach proposed in the current study was effective in art history education.

AB  - The aim of this systematic review was to investigate current penetration and educational quality enhancements from digitalization in the dental curriculum. Using a modified PICO strategy, the literature was searched using PubMed supplemented with a manual search to identify English-language articles published between 1994 and 2020 that reported the use of digital techniques in dental education. A total of 211 articles were identified by electronic search, of which 55 articles were selected for inclusion and supplemented with 27 additional publications retrieved by manual search, resulting in 82 studies that were included in the review. Publications were categorized into five areas of digital dental education: Web-based knowledge transfer and e-learning, digital surface mapping, dental simulator motor skills (including intraoral optical scanning), digital radiography, and surveys related to the penetration and acceptance of digital education. This review demonstrates that digitalization offers great potential to revolutionize dental education to help prepare future dentists for their daily practice. More interactive and intuitive e-learning possibilities will arise to stimulate an enjoyable and meaningful educational experience with 24/7 facilities. Augmented and virtual reality technology will likely play a dominant role in the future of dental education.

AB  - Virtual Reality scenarios where emitters convey information to receptors can be used as a tool for distance learning and to enable virtual visits to company physical headquarters. However, immersive Virtual Reality setups usually require visualization interfaces such as Head-mounted Displays, Powerwalls or CAVE systems, supported by interaction devices (Microsoft Kinect, Wii Motion, among others), that foster natural interaction but are often inaccessible to users. We propose a virtual presentation scenario, supported by a framework, that provides emotion-driven interaction through ubiquitous devices. An experiment with 3 conditions was designed involving: a control condition; a less confusing text script based on its lexical, syntactical, and bigram features; and a third condition where an adaptive lighting system dynamically acted based on the user's engagement. Results show that users exposed to the less confusing script reported higher sense of presence, albeit without statistical significance. Users from the last condition reported lower sense of presence, which rejects our hypothesis without statistical significance. We theorize that, as the presentation was given orally and the adaptive lighting system impacts the visual channel, this conflict may have overloaded the users' cognitive capacity and thus reduced available resources to address the presentation content.

AB  - Although the integration of virtual world in teaching and learning has been investigated, there is a scarcity of research considering its influence on assessing learners' understanding and comparing it with traditional e-assessment tools such as that in Moodle quiz. In this research, a virtual reality (VR) game-based e-assessment application was designed first. Subsequently, the study aims at (1) understanding whether the type of e-assessment method can affect students' performance, and (2) investigating the difference in learners' perceptions based on the type of e-assessment technology. A combination of quasi-pre-test and post-test experimental and survey research design methods were adopted. Overall, 32 undergraduate students were assigned to either control (N=17) or experimental (N=15) group. The key findings are (1) no statistical differences in students' performance were found for both groups, and (2) significant differences between learners who completed the VR game-based e-assessment and those on the control group were found on perceived playfulness and ease of use. The conclusion drawn from the research outcomes is that a VR game-based e-assessment application is a successful approach to enhance learners' engagement in evaluation sessions, although students may face a lack of experience in its use.

AB  - Over the last decades, research has shown that students of all ages experience difficulties in understanding cellular transport mechanisms, especially when it comes to processes on the molecular level such as osmosis and diffusion. One major difficulty in the comprehension of these basic concepts is their abstract nature along with the demand for high spatial ability. To address this problem a virtual reality-based application has been developed, which allows students to freely explore molecular transport mechanisms across the cell membrane by interacting with the environment and manipulating the molecule concentration or initiate transport mechanisms by actively moving molecules. An accompanying study showed an increase in the understanding of osmosis and diffusion after using the e-learning application.

AB  - Chemical educators are facing a new generation of instructional technologies that impact classroom teaching. New technologies, like smartphones, cloud computing and artificial intelligence take learning beyond the classroom; 3D printing, virtual reality, and augmented reality provide new ways to teach the virtualization skills that are important for chemists. These technologies cause students to become more isolated, so students may not develop the social skills that they will need for today's workplace. Individualized learning may be beneficial to many students, but it will create challenges for faculty. Although this article focuses on chemistry education, it should be apparent that a similar argument could be made for other sciences, like physics and biology.

AB  - Schools are increasingly pivoting to the use of digital technologies to support both teaching and learning. In this study, the educational use of 360-degree video in the primary school classroom is investigated, focusing on a platform that was developed by an Australian university, which incorporates a chat function as well as an analytics tool. In examining these aspects, a qualitative study, drawing on a sociocultural and multimodal framework, was undertaken with two Australian primary school classes. It was found that the platform provided students with increased access to information and control, as well as supporting interactions. Additionally, it was found that the analytics tool provided teachers with access to information on student engagement. Some educational limitations of the platform are reported on.

AB  - The present pilot study examined collaborative creativity in virtual and mixed reality. Comparing equivalent mixed and virtual reality environments, we explored whether different environments can potentially influence users' creative production when asked to generate new ideas on water and energy sparing. We adopted the Linkography approach to evaluate participants creative performance by assessing not only the final brainstorming output but also the step-by-step processes of forming ideas [2]. We looked at both participants' individual ideas (i.e., node) and their relationships with former ideas (i.e., link). Our results demonstrated participants generated more ideas, and more unique ideas, when they were in the VR condition. Implication and avenues for future work are discussed accordingly.

AB  - Viewed as the curriculum of the future, coding, VR, and 3D printing have made their way into the K-12 classrooms. Yet, despite their expectations to enhance student learning, many lessons surrounding the use of these technologies belong to the "one-off" variety without an overarching integrated pedagogy. c3d.io is a web-based, block-oriented, programming platform that makes it easy to create 3D environments with a few clicks. With features, such as external assets importing, stereoscopic rendering, real-time head tracking, and smartphone deployment, c3d.io allows the creation of fun, integrated, exploration based projects (like the one described above) for K-12 students. Using Google's Blockly and Javascript as its main language, the system is extremely easy to use by both teachers and students.

KW  - Science education
AB  - Training students in basic concepts of physics, such as the ones related to mass, volume, or density, is much more complicated than just stating the underlying definitions and laws. One of the reasons for this is that most students have deeply rooted delusions and misconceptions about the behavior of objects, sometimes close to magical thinking. Many innovative and promising technologies, in particular Virtual Reality (VR), can be used to enhance student learning.
   We compared the effectiveness of a serious immersive game in teaching the concept of density in various conditions: a2Dversion in an embeddedweb browser and a 3D immersive game in VR. We also developed a specific questionnaire to assess students' knowledge improvement. Primary results have shown an increase in learning efficiency using VR. Also, most students were able to see the short-comings of their initial theories and revise them, which means that they improved their understanding of this topic.

AB  - Most past research in the area of serious games for simulation has focused on games with constrained multiple-choice based dialogue systems. Recent advancements in natural language processing research make free-input text classification-based dialogue systems more feasible, but an effective framework for collecting training data for such systems has not yet been developed. This paper presents methods for collecting and generating data for training a free-input classification-based system. Various data crowdsourcing prompt types are presented. A binary category system, which increases the fidelity of the labeling to make free-input classification more effective, is presented. Finally, a data generation algorithm based on the binary data labeling system is presented. Future work will use the data crowdsourcing and generation methods presented here to implement a free-input dialogue system in a virtual reality (VR) simulation designed for cultural competency training.

AB  - Aim To introduce virtual reality (VR) into the endodontic curriculum for teaching root canal anatomy and to evaluate the effectiveness of this new method on third-year undergraduate students. Methodology Extracted human teeth were digitized using a CBCT scan and converted into STL files. The corresponding files were either 3D printed or imported into a VR software program. Subsequently, forty-two third-year undergraduate dental students in preclinical training were asked to respond to a questionnaire analysing their ability to detect all the anatomic features of the replica teeth and their comprehension of the underlying root canal anatomy. The investigation was based on three different methods: two-dimensional radiography, CBCT scanning and VR simulation. Data were analysed using McNemar's and binomial test, and the level of significance was set to 0.05 (P = 0.05). Results Students reported that CBCT and VR allowed them to detect all anatomic features more than radiography (P P = 0.049). Because it allowed improved comprehension of root canal anatomy, the VR simulation was considered better than CBCT scanning and radiography. Most of the students adapted well to the VR simulation. Conclusions Dental students greatly appreciated the integration of VR simulation into the endodontic curriculum. From a didactic point of view, VR has considerable advantages over three-dimensional reconstructions and two-dimensional radiographs when teaching root canal anatomy.

AB  - An educational escape activity was developed, embedding elements of both augmented and immersive virtual reality technologies, in an active learning environment. The mental visualization of abstract concepts can be difficult for students, inhibiting their ability to reason cogently regarding important topics of stereochemistry. Consequently, an educational escape room coupled with immersive technologies can be utilized to foster teamwork and critical thinking while encouraging student interaction with three-dimensional virtual molecular phenomena. Nine participants were recruited from the University of East Anglia to complete the activity. From this first experience, student feedback and subsequent thematic analysis show not only the significant positive impacts on student engagement and learning but also the potential of this paradigm to be adopted as an educational tool.

AB  - Communication and teamworking skills are essential healthcare professional skills, yet undergraduates exhibit reluctance to engage with group work, especially in interprofessional groups. The aim of the study was to investigate whether a virtual reality bomb-defusing simulator would enable students to gain these skills through an enjoyable and challenging scenario without profession-specific knowledge. Students took it in turns to play the role of the 'Defuser' immersed in a headset, while the rest of the group were 'Experts' with a printed manual, but no sight of the bomb. The task challenged students to relay obscure symbols and instructions to each other rapidly and effectively. A subsequent focus group explored the impact of the simulation on students' perceived learning, engagement and communication skills. The focus group of five multiprofessional healthcare students reported high levels of engagement and satisfaction while highlighting value in developing communication and teamwork. The simulator nurtured initial group dynamics and team bonding. Evaluation data indicated that the intervention facilitated cooperation, team bonding and the development of good communication skills. This method of encouraging communication would fit well into an interprofessional learning session as a useful tool ahead of more technical and clinically based group work.

AB  - Deep and meaningful learning (DML) in distant education should be an essential outcome of quality education. In this literature review, we focus on e-learning effectiveness along with the factors and conditions leading to DML when using social virtual reality environments (SVREs) in distance mode higher education (HE). Hence, a systematic literature review was conducted summarizing the findings from thirty-three empirical studies in HE between 2004 (appearance of VR) and 2019 (before coronavirus appearance). We searched for the cognitive, social, and affective aspects of DML in a research framework and studied their weight in SVREs. The findings suggest that the use of SVREs can provide authentic, simulated, cognitively challenging experiences in engaging, motivating environments for open-ended social and collaborative interactions and intentional, personalized learning. Furthermore, the findings indicate that educators and SVRE designers need to place more emphasis on the socio-cultural semiotics and emotional aspects of e-learning and ethical issues such as privacy and security. The mediating factors for DML in SVREs were accumulated and classified in the resultant Blended Model for Deep and Meaningful e-learning in SVREs. Improvement recommendations include meaningful contexts, purposeful activation, learner agency, intrinsic emotional engagement, holistic social integration, and meticulous user obstacle removal.

AB  - Traditional science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education is sometimes criticized for lacking approaches to present real-world practices and phenomena beyond naked eyes. Head-mounted display virtual reality (HMD VR) provides opportunities to solve this issue. However, little is known about the impact of this approach on student's self-efficacy in science. This study is to address this knowledge gap. Sixty-six 11th grade students were recruited to participate in an HMD VR learning activity. Half of these students filled in a science self-efficacy questionnaire before the VR learning activity, and the others filled in it after the activity. The study compared (1) students' science self-efficacy between these two conditions and (2) students' post-activity science self-efficacy among different science-class grading score groups. Results showed that the change of students' science self-efficacy was not significant after the learning activity and the differences among most science-class grading score groups were small. After the results were analyzed, the capability of affording gestures and physical movement was recognized as an important factor that determined whether an HMD VR learning environment could significantly enhance students' science self-efficacy; educators were suggested to not use science class scores to predict students' potential and future achievements in science.

AB  - Social creativity refers to the creativity of individuals to deal with and solve social problems in novel, unique, appropriate and effective ways. Social creativity can be classified into two types: stable trait creativity and unstable state creativity. Using questionnaire method and quasi-experimental design, the present study examined the strategic variability of college students, either with high trait social creativity (HT) or low trait social creativity (LT), in the virtual simulated situations across four consecutive days. The result showed that: (1) both the HT participants and the LT participants preferred low original and high appropriate strategies. (2) compared to the LT participants, the advantage of the HT participants was mainly reflected in strategy appropriateness and there were no obvious improvements on strategy appropriateness across time.

AB  - This study investigated the affordances and constraints of a VR-based learning environment for the teaching training of university graduate teaching assistants in relation to the task, goal-based scenarios, and learning support design. Seventeen graduate teaching assistants participated in a multiple-case study with an OpenSimulator-supported, simulation-based teaching training program. The study indicated that the VR-based learning environment fostered participants' performance of interactive teaching and demonstrative instruction, while training them to notice and attend to students' actions/reactions during the instruction. On the other hand, there is a competition between physical reality and functional intelligence in the VR environment. We propose the integration of experience, affordance, and learner analyses in planning and designing a VR-supported learning intervention.

AB  - Virtual reality (VR) can promote design performance, and may generate a high cognitive load and affect creative design thinking as well. In order to examine the effect of VR application on cognitive load and engineering design creativity, this study recruited 81 eighth-grade students as participants and employed a non-equivalent-groups quasi-experimental design to examine how VR application influences creativity components and creative performance. A creativity component scale (creative motivation, creative thinking, and professional cognition), a measurement of creative performance, and a cognitive load scale were used to collect data. The study also investigated the ability of VR application to predict creativity components and creative performance, using cognitive load as the mediator. The conclusions are as follows: (1) VR application had marked effects on professional cognition and creative motivation but no effect on creative thinking skills. (2) VR application had marked effects on the novelty and usefulness aspects of creative performance, particularly with respect to usefulness. (3) VR application had marked effects on extraneous and germane cognitive load, but no influence on intrinsic cognitive load, and (4) Both VR application and cognitive load were able to predict creativity components and creative performance. Their abilities to predict creative performance approached an acceptable level. Nevertheless, VR application had no effect on general creative thinking skills; therefore, other teaching strategies are needed to strengthen creative thinking.

AB  - Purpose - This paper aims to describe the design and user testing of GeoForge, a multiple-player digital learning experience for middle school that leverages virtual reality (VR) and individualized websites for learning concepts in planetary science. This paper investigates how specific instructional design choices and features of the technology fostered collaborative behaviors.
   Design/methodology/approach - GeoForge was implemented in 3 middle school classrooms with a total of 220 students. Learners used GeoForge in class in groups of 3-4 to learn about planetary science. A mixed-methods approach examined collaboration using classroom observations, teacher interviews, student surveys and student artifacts. Using Jeong and Hmelo-Silver's (2016) seven affordances of technology for collaborative learning, this paper identifies ways in which features of GeoForge supported collaborative behaviors.
   Findings - Instructional design which combined VR and the digital science journal (DSJ) helped foster collaboration. Some collaborative behaviors were especially notable in classrooms that did not regularly practice these skills. Segmenting tasks in the DSJ, clarifying instructions to articulate ideas, showing other group members' responses onscreen and enabling multiuser VR environments contributed to collaborative behaviors and a satisfying learning experience as observed and documented through multiple methods.
   Originality/value - GeoForge successfully integrated VR and personalized websites in a classroom planetary science lesson, an approach which balanced instructional design and logistical challenges while creating opportunities for collaboration.

AB  - This paper reports on a study which designed and developed a multi-fingered haptic interface in conjunction with a three-dimensional (3D) virtual model of a section of the cell membrane in order to enable students to work collaboratively to learn cell biology. Furthermore, the study investigated whether the addition of haptic feedback to the 3D virtual reality (VR) simulation affected learning of key concepts in nanoscale cell biology for students aged 12 to 13. The haptic interface was designed so that the haptic feedback could be turned on or switched off. Students (N = 64), in two secondary schools, worked in pairs, on activities designed to support learning of specific difficult concepts. Findings from observation of the activities and interviews revealed that students believed that being immersed in the 3D VR environment and being able to feel structures and movements within the model and work collaboratively assisted their learning. More specifically, the pilot/co-pilot model that we developed was successful for enabling collaborative learning and reducing the isolating effects of immersion with a 3D headset. Results of pre and post-tests of conceptual knowledge showed significant knowledge gains but addition of haptic feedback did not affect the knowledge gains significantly. The study enabled identification of important issues to consider when designing and using haptic-enabled 3D VR environments for collaborative learning.

AB  - The opportunity to bring real experience to the classroom in order to promote active learning and student engagement is achieved through extended realities as virtual reality (VR). The use of VR cases in engineering education has promote a flexible learning space (real industrial facilities) and the increasing of the students' motivation. This research had the objective to evaluate the impact of using VR cases versus using traditional cases in two different campi of a private university, in the same academic course during 2 weeks. The methodology has 3 phases: (1) case design with VR and with the traditional paper case format, (2) application of the cases (VR and traditional) in two groups (no control group, it was the same group). (3) Results analysis based on observations, direct surveys, and students reports. This experience contributed to understand the dynamics of the case methodology under two perspectives: students and professors. While real experience, innovation, and fun represent the student's perspective using VR to understand layout facilities and work design as real application concept, from a professor's perspective this experience derived in more student engagement, critical thinking and systemic perspective. In addition, the process to develop VR cases was for itself an interesting challenge from academic and industrial possibilities, but allows us to develop active learning in-and out- of the classroom.

AB  - Precise and accurate navigation is an elementary expectation in desktop virtual realities. In this paper, the navigation method of MaxWhere VR is presented, furthermore, it is analyzed in terms of interaction fidelity and controller mapping. The MaxWhere VR platform offers different navigational operations, that are optimized for an external mouse with a scroll wheel. Besides moving forward and backward, rotating the camera view and lifting, another navigation type is available, the spherical orbit. This navigational operation is known from engineering software, and its role is to look around a selected object and observe it from each side. This function can be useful in educational and exhibition spaces where 3D models are located. These navigational operations are considered low-fidelity interactions, compared to human motions, although with the directionally mapped general control devices, such as a mouse, high perceived naturalness can be achieved that can relate to a higher sense of spatial presence.

AB  - Immersive virtual reality learning environments (VRLEs) have great potential but they do not guarantee effective or in-depth learning. Activating learners by including prompts, has been reported to increase learning in VR. Based on their promising effects in conventional settings, elaboration prompts should increase learning outcomes by activating learners to explain the learning content in their own words or to contrast it to prior knowledge. In our study, we investigated the effect of an elaboration prompt before entering the VRLE on learning robotics. Our between-subject study (prompt vs. no prompt) included N = 64 participants. We applied a multi-method approach (functional and structural) to measure mental models. We used a differentiated learning outcome measurement (knowledge, comprehension, and application) as a functional measurement. By using the structural assessment of knowledge technique, we deduce the structural accuracy of the developed mental model. We found an increase by the elaboration prompt on knowledge level but not on comprehension or application level. The interplay of preaccuracy and prompt had a significant impact on structural accuracy after learning. Application level and structural accuracy after learning were positively correlated. Our multi-method approach delivered insights on different aspects of the developed mental model when prompting before entering the VRLE. For future research, further approaches to explore in-depth learning in VRLEs are recommended.

AB  - Nowadays having qualified and experienced teachers in school classrooms is considered to be of the highest priority in any society. However, most teachers report that they haven't received sufficient practical training to manage disruptive situations in the classroom. Fortunately, virtual reality can provide a solution to this issue. This paper will introduce ClassroomVR-MotionCapture (CVR-MC) and its evaluation by experts. CVR-MC is an IT tool that can simulate a virtual classroom, thus allowing different users to face real-life problems that usually take place in real classrooms. The system captures the users' tone of voice and the substance of their speech, as well as their gaze and corporal movements. Virtual students will react according to these parameters. To evaluate the usability and functionality of the tool, we conducted a study involving 14 education professionals. The research question that guided the study was the following: is it possible to use the CVR-MC system in teacher training to improve teachers' communication skills for classroom climate management? The main conclusion of our study is that many participants described the CVRMC system as a friendly, safe and feasible environment for teacher training, especially for improving their classroom climate management competence. However, the study also found that the emotions detected through the users' body expression did not match the emotions they reported feeling during the test.

AB  - Background: The majority of undergraduate anatomy learning has shifted online, or to a mixture of virtual and face-to-face teaching, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Cadaveric shortages have also influenced the need for alternative methods of anatomical education. This study examines the current literature on the use of extended reality technologies (XR) such as Virtual reality (VR), Augmented reality (AR), and Mixed reality (MR) for anatomy teaching and explores its potential for implementation in medical education. Methods: A literature review was performed of PubMed, ProQuest, Science Direct, and Springer databases. Included studies were assessed for user satisfaction, perceived effectiveness, cost, acceptability and side effects. Results: The database search identified 1687 papers, of which 45 papers were included in this review. Both AR and VR had high rates of satisfaction and acceptability as a supplementary teaching aid amongst un-dergraduate participants. AR was found to have higher effectiveness than VR. VR is more expensive than AR. Results and comparisons were limited due to short length of study. Conclusions: VR is a popular choice with undergraduates as an aid to supplement teaching, in spite of the associated cost and side effects such as nausea. AR has shown the most potential for independent study. Larger and long-term studies are required to determine true effectiveness, and consideration of the clinical relevance of these technologies.

AB  - Immersive technology, such as virtual reality (VR) experiences, has the ability to enhance forensic science chemistry education by allowing students to view realistic crime scenes. With the help of a WebVR software such as Uptale, we created a VR crime scene activity that students can participate in remotely with the help of their mobile device. Students were tasked to investigate a VR crime scene and collect evidence for subsequent analysis. They would then complete an online report, where they would report the evidence they had collected and subsequently perform crime scene reconstruction to describe what they think happened at the crime scene. Overall, 84% of students enjoyed the activity and would recommend others to try the VR crime scene experience.

AB  - Information science has played an important role in computer science education in the last decades. The design of storing, retrieving and interacting with information is an obligatory part in development of numerous online services in our era. Therefore, many parts of information science are elementary components in the majors' curricula in computer science education. In this paper, we focus on a course on Information Architecture where students were introduced to the basics of information science. During the course, MaxWhere - an online virtual reality collaborative service - was used as a framework. In our research, our main goal was to develop the students' cognitive processes. The students' main task was to design and develop e-health services in virtual reality (VR) environment for impressing and persuading their future target audience to live a more environmentally conscious life or to live healthier. In this paper, we present some results of this experimental research: Students were motivated to create and design an inclusive project together that needed more work and knowledge from them than it had been planned. They were motivated to collaborate with their groupmates and a self-driven collaborative workflow was developed. They had to learn about the MaxWhere 3D VR system, and at the same time, they had to start to do research on their own projects. After a while, they found gaps in their designs that they wanted to fill in. As a consequence, the students had to deal with some theory and practice of marketing, e.g., they had to deal and work with buyer personas, with some other marketing aspects, and - of course - with some important parts of information science. They had to imagine their future customers and to develop VR environments for them that could have an impact on the users' behavior and lives. The design and development process resulted in and showed development in the students' cognitive processes.

AB  - Introduction
   Poor knowledge retention is one reason for medical student attrition in learning and has been a huge concern in medical education. Three-dimensional virtual reality (3D-VR)-based teaching and learning in medical education has been promoted to improve student learning outcomes. This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of 3D-VR in knowledge retention in human anatomy courses as compared to traditional teaching methods among medical students.
   Methods
   A convergent mixed methods design was utilized to evaluate learning outcomes in terms of short- and long-term knowledge retention scores among students using 3D-VR and those using traditional models and to describe students' experiences and views of the use of 3D-VR as a teaching and learning tool.
   Results
   Male students who used the 3D-VR tool had significantly higher short- and long-term knowledge scores than males who used the traditional methods. Meanwhile, females who used traditional methods showed significantly higher short-term knowledge scores than females who used 3D-VR.
   Conclusion
   Medical students described 3D-VR as a learning tool with a great deal to offer for learning human anatomy as compared to traditional methods. Therefore, we recommend adding the use of 3D-VR in the anatomy curriculum. However, several 3D-VR limitations were also identified, which may hinder its utilization for teaching and learning. These concerns must be addressed before 3D-VR tools are considered for implementation in medical education human anatomy courses.

AB  - This study examines the effectiveness of virtual reality (VR) technology as an innovative learning platform in developing intercultural competence, including intercultural knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs. The research was based on data from undergraduate STEM students in a first-year technology course at a large public university in the Midwestern U.S. (n = 101). Online questionnaires measuring the universality-diversity dimension, tolerance of ambiguity, intercultural sensitivity, and cultural knowledge were used to collect pre-posttest data pre- and postintervention. Paired sample t-tests assessing various components of intercultural competence yielded mean score increases from directly before (T1) to two weeks after (T2) the VR intervention. Furthermore, the study tested the specific relationship of participants' Intercultural Development Inventory (IDI) scores to intercultural competence measures. A linear regression revealed that students' pre-training IDI and cultural knowledge scores were significant predictors of their MGUDS score change, controlling for demographic variables such as gender, ethnicity, international student status, travel, and life history. Since objective measures of knowledge increased while self-report instruments such as the MGUDS showed mean decreases, the VR-based learning environment seems to have encouraged learners to develop a more realistic selfassessment of their level of intercultural competence. Results from this study suggest the importance of immersion (even when mobility is not possible) in developing intercultural competence and the potentials of VR technology in advancing intercultural learning. Implications for research and practice of intercultural competence development are discussed.

AB  - Advancement in virtual reality (VR) technology has enabled language learners to be engaged in immersive and interactive learning environments. Recent studies have revealed that the educational use of VR technology can improve students' writing achievement, behavioral engagement, and cognitive engagement in learning. However, the factors contributing to these improvements are not fully understood. Writing programs that foster a positive writing self-concept is helpful for students' development. In this study, adopting the self-determination theory as the theoretical lens, the affordances of VR contributing to students' self-concept in descriptive writing (DW) were explored through a newly adapted survey. Secondary school students (n = 300) who attended a VR-supported writing course completed the survey that measured their responses to five related factors: (i) autonomous observation, (ii) relatedness, (iii) self-efficacy, (iv) satisfaction, and (v) writing self-concept. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted to validate the five-factor survey measurements. The results indicated that the construct validity and reliability of the survey were acceptable. A structural equation model was constructed to investigate the hypothesized relationships of the factors contributing to the students' writing self-concept. The results indicated self-efficacy and satisfaction directly predict students' writing self-concept, and relatedness indirectly predicts writing self-concept. These findings reveal the underlying mechanism which could inform educators who are keen on promoting or harnessing VR-supported learning and teaching in writing education.

AB  - The arrival of COVID-19 restrictions and the increasing demand of online instruction options posed challenges to education communities worldwide, especially in human anatomy. In response, Colorado State University developed and deployed an 8-week-long large-scale virtual reality (VR) course to supplement online human anatomy instruction. Students (n = 75) received a VR-capable laptop and head-mounted display and participated in weekly synchronous group laboratory sessions with instructors. The software enabled students to remotely collaborate in a common virtual space to work with human anatomy using an artist-rendered cadaver. Qualitative data were collected on student engagement, confidence, and reactions to the new technology. Quantitative data assessed student knowledge acquisition and retention of anatomical spatial relationships. Results indicated that students performed better in the online course (mean = 82.27%) when compared to previous in-person laboratories (mean = 80.08%). The utilization of VR promoted student engagement and increased opportunities for student interaction with teaching assistants, peers, and course content. Notably, students reported benefits that focused on unique aspects of their virtual learning environment, including the ability to infinitely scale the cadaver and walk inside and around anatomical structures. Results suggested that using VR was equivalent to 2D methods in student learning and retention of anatomical relationships. Overall, the virtual classroom maintained the rigor of traditional gross anatomy laboratories without negatively impacting student examination scores and provided a high level of accessibility, without compromising learner engagement.

AB  - Human anatomy education has been traditionally taught using methods such as lecture and cadaveric dissection. Modern technologies that enhance 3-dimensional (3D) visualization, such as virtual reality (VR), are currently being implemented as adjuncts. VR technology provides a level of 3D visualization and interactivity that allows users to explore structures in ways that are often unattainable by direct cadaveric dissection. For example, users can experience simulations in which they can teleport themselves to structures inside of a virtual human body, resize and observe objects from any visual perspective, and draw in a 3D space to test their understanding. In the following study, the utility of VR in anatomy education was assessed and compared with traditional teaching methods including lecture and cadaveric dissection. A VR platform was created in which first-year medical students identified anatomical structures on a virtual cadaveric specimen and then drew these structures on a virtual skeleton using a 3D drawing tool. After completing these tasks, subjects answered survey questions that assessed the usefulness of the virtual platform for learning the names and locations of anatomical structures and understanding 3D anatomical relationships. The survey was also used to evaluate the perceived educational value of VR relative to lectures and cadaveric dissection. The results of our study showed strong subject support for VR technology, suggesting VR is a helpful tool for learning human anatomy and a useful adjunct to lecture and cadaveric dissection.

AB  - Live-line maintenance is a high risk activity. Hence, lineworkers require effective and safe training. Virtual Reality Training Systems (VRTS) provide an affordable and safe alternative for training in such high risk environments. However, their effectiveness relies mainly on having meaningful activities for supporting learning and on their ability to detect untrained students. This study builds a student model based on Learning Analytics (LA), using data collected from 1399 students that used a VRTS for the maintenance training of lineworkers in 329 courses carried out from 2008 to 2016. By employing several classifiers, the model allows discriminating between trained and untrained students in different maneuvers using three minimum evaluation proficiency scores. Using the best classifier, a Feature Importance Analysis is carried out to understand the impact of the variables regarding the trainees' final performances. The model also involves the exploration of the trainees' trace data through a visualization tool to pose nonobservable behavioral variables related to displayed errors. The results show that the model can discriminate between trained and untrained students, the Random Forest algorithm standing out. The feature importance analysis revealed that the most relevant features regarding the trainees' final performance were profile and course variables along with specific maneuver steps. Finally, using the visual tool, and with human expert aid, several error patterns in trace data associated with misconceptions and confusion were identified. In the light of these, LA enables disassembling the data jigsaw quandary from VRTS to enhance the human-in-the-loop evaluation.

AB  - Staying sustainable in the world of cultural heritage is a major organizational challenge nationally and internationally. Due to the global financial crisis the funds available to sustain the operations of museums and libraries become difficult not only to obtain them but also to utilized them effectively and efficiently. The operational costs of museums increase over the time due to exhibit maintenance and acquisition costs. This cost is inversely proportional to the revenues that can be generated. Virtual reality, avatar technologies, virtual worlds, holograms, gaming and gamification can offer creative interactivity and unique experiences with low or no cost to the global visitor and introduce new revenue streams. This paper practically integrates the realization of digital cultural strategies and operations within the context of digital humanities economics that can turn museums and libraries from cost centres to profit centres for the benefit of the humanity and the society.

AB  - Internet of Digital Reality (IoD) is a concept that extends the Internet of Things (IoT) with the management, transmission and harmonization of digital realities. IoD covers aspects of connectivity, accessibility and usability with respect to different cognitive entities present in the digital world, via a confluence of technologies including virtual reality, artificial intelligence and 2D digital environments, in a way that recognizes human factors and cognitive aspects as key issues. Devices, interfaces, and interacting entities can be enabled through IoD to share digital realities and to thereby build a new level of reality, using intelligent connections mostly based on immersive virtual scenarios and multi-modal interactions in both public and private networks. In this paper, we look into the infrastructural requirements of and challenges behind the Internet of Digital Reality, which must be solved in order to deliver a high-quality user experience while keeping the increasing complexity of these networks at bay.

AB  - Virtual reality (VR) and gamification are two topics that are of interest to the higher education. This study was conducted with 102 students of the health department of IMC university of applied sciences. Two versions of a VR game have been designed, one with highscore and achievements and the other without those elements but with time pressure instead. Each group consisted of a cohort of students. The results showed that the group without highscore and achievements were more motivated to play the game and felt more supported by the game while studying than the group with those gamification elements. Even though the majority of students with time pressure stated that they found it disturbing, it did not have a negative effect on their overall evaluation of the game itself and their motivation. The outcome suggests that a highscore and achievements lead to higher competition and evaluation which is known to have negative impact on intrinsic motivation.

AB  - Ways to support employees' performance of creativity tasks are critical of sustainable business competitiveness. Since many existing creativity software applications make use of pictures to uplift users' creativity performance, immersive systems should potentially achieve similar beneficial effects. This study adheres to several theories and concepts, including Amabile's (2011) componential theory of creativity, Csikszentmihaly's (1996) flow theory and Jansson and Smith's (1991) design fixation. The study aims to explore whether and how individual immersive VR systems can enhance creativity performance. The results of the study will shed light on the underlying mechanism through which immersive systems render impacts to individual creativity performance. A better understanding of creativity performance on individual level facilitates future exploration of how collaboration work in the immersive systems can be improved. On practical implication, it will contribute to the expanding interests in the use of immersive systems in business training contexts.

AB  - This paper presents a Virtual Reality (VR) game aimed at phlebotomy learning in real-life contexts. 360 degrees-images and -videos of existing laboratories were used as the basis of the virtual environment. The game was designed with a focus on problem- and inquiry-based learning through exploration of laboratories with VR mini-games and interaction opportunities for essential procedural learning tasks. The results are based on usability and user experience evaluations from 6 students and 5 educators. Aspects related to games' attractiveness, engagement and enjoyment were highly rated, though several improvements were deemed necessary before the application should be used in practice. The result contrasts the different opinions of teachers and students. While teachers were more critical regarding usability problems, they were positive towards using gamified experiences for procedural learning. Students wished to have even more gamified tasks and a better flow between tasks or environments.

AB  - Many studies have shown that physical activity, especially walking, tends to stimulate certain cognitive functions, including divergent creativity. The objective of this study was to understand whether some of this gain comes from the perception of movement, and not merely physical activity itself. 32 participants carried out divergent and convergent creativity tasks in a virtual reality environment consisting of a train inside a tunnel, while wearing a Head-Mounted-Display (HMD). For half of the participants, the virtual train was running, and they could therefore see tunnel lamps passing by through the windows. For the other half, the train was stationary. The results of this study indicate that participants perform better at tasks that require divergent creativity when the virtual environment is moving than when it is at a standstill. These results lead to recommendations for the design of tools and environments for meetings and creativity workshops.

AB  - During previous years, researchers from TUKE (Technical University of Kosice) and MSU (Mississippi State University) collaborated on building a virtual immersive training environment for law enforcement officers. The training tool was designed for operation in Virtual Reality (VR) using HMD (Head Mounted Display) and 3D Desktop modes. The goal was to control a Jaguar V4 robot in a virtual environment using both joystick and voice commands, because not all functions could be accessed by hand controllers alone. The speech recognition was designed for English speakers. Firstly it was tested at MSU with five US participants and later the same tests were repeated with 16 students at TUKE, who were non-native English speakers. This article provides an overview of the experiment and a comparison of cognitive aspects and user acceptance levels resulted from these trials on different continents and different English speakers (native and non-native ones).

AB  - With rapid development of 3D virtual scene, virtual reality (VR) technology starts to be applied in teaching practice. Because of its conception and innovation, VR technology has certain advantage in art creation learning and teaching. In traditional art course teaching, theoretical knowledge is more than design practice, and the depth of design cases is insufficient. Thus, students lack driving force of art creation. On this basis, wall painting technology and VR technology were combined and applied in the course of Illustration Design in this paper. According to the course requirement of Illustration Design - many design cases, Illustration Design teaching mode based on virtual wall painting technology was constructed. The study result showed that, students more approved the new teaching mode, their interest improved greatly and teaching efficiency boosted significantly. The teaching mode can make up for defects of traditional art design teaching mode and contributes to cultivating students' art creation ability.

AB  - This article focuses on the dialogue between Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH) and technology, specifically within the domain of traditional craftsmanship. We begin by establishing the current methods of safeguarding traditional crafts, as described in previous issues of this journal, and the benefits and limitations of these. This is followed by an introduction to the concept of digitisation and the Tripartite Digitisation Model (TDM) for capturing, representing and disseminating ICH through digital means. Through a case study of digitising a traditional joinery technique, we explore different methods for capturing data about ICH and reflect on their use for digitisation. The ICH is represented through 3D models, video clips and audio voice-over, and disseminated in an interactive VR simulation. After evaluating the simulation with the people whose ICH we were trying to safeguard, we discuss the benefits and limitations of moving the ICH from its original context into a digital one.

AB  - Although the population of science teachers in the US lacks diversity, the technology used to teach science should be diverse and culturally connected. Culturally relevant frameworks for science call for science teaching to be situated in meaningful contexts. This study calls for the integration of CRP and situated cognition perspectives as a means of designing pedagogically effective virtual reality. This mixed-methods study explored N = 444 students changes in attitudes after experiencing VR lessons on an attitude survey and qualitative short answers. We found that all students who used the VR improved their attitudes towards science. We also found that students who used the CRP designed VR developed a conscious and politically aware application of science. The results suggest that educational technology should carefully consider how using CRP-based approaches can have both cognitive and cultural implications of students' learning.

AB  - This paper investigated the spatial perception of size in a virtual space using a wire free mobile Virtual Reality (VR). A simple game called, The Object Popping Project (OPP) that allows the user to find and pop out a 3D object in VR has been developed and used as a tool to measure human spatial perception. The purpose of the OPP is to know how our spatial cognitive abilities differ we planned to get help of VR technology. A total of 7 spheres of different sizes in a 3D space were used in the OPP and the user had to gaze at any of the spheres for 3 s to select and pop it out. A study with 30 participants revealed that there was no effect by colors or numbers in perceiving the different sizes of the object. However, there was a gender effect that on an average, male participants spent less time than female participants in all the tasks.

AB  - Cardiac anatomy can be challenging to grasp because of its complex three-dimensional nature and remains one of the most challenging topics to teach. In light of some exciting technological advances in the field of virtual reality (VR), we sought to test the viability and the assess efficacy of this computer-generated model for the purposes of teaching cardiac anatomy. Before learning cardiac anatomy, first-year undergraduate medical students participated in an anatomically correct VR simulation of the heart. Students were randomly distributed into control and variable groups. Each student completed a pre-intervention quiz, consisting of 10 multiple choice questions with 5 conventional cardiac anatomy questions and 5 visual-spatial (VS) questions. The control group continued to independent study, whereas the variable group subjects were exposed to a 30-min immersive cardiac VR experience. At the end of the intervention, both the groups underwent a separate post-intervention 10-question quiz. Forty-two students participated in the cardiac VR experiment, separated into 14 control and 28 variable subjects. They scored 50.9% on average on the pre-intervention quiz (SD = 16.5) and 70.2% on the post-intervention quiz (SD = 18.7). Compared to the control group, the students exposed to VR scored 21.4% higher in conventional content (P = 0.004), 26.4% higher in VS content (P < 0.001), and 23.9% higher overall (P < 0.001). VR offers an anatomically correct and immersive VS environment that permits learner to interact three-dimensionally with the heart's anatomy. This study demonstrates the viability and the effectiveness of VR in teaching cardiac anatomy. (c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Technologies such as virtual reality are used in higher education to develop virtual learning resources (VLRs). These VLRs can be delivered in multiple modalities, from truly immersive involving wearable devices to less immersive modalities such as desktop. However, research investigating perceptions of VLRs in anatomy has mainly focused on a single delivery modality and a limited-demographic participant cohort, warranting a comparison of different modalities and a consideration of different cohorts. This pilot study aimed to compare perceptions of highly immersive and less immersive VLR deliveries among anatomy students and tutors and evaluate the impact of prior university experience on students' perceptions of VLRs. A skull anatomy VLR was developed using the Unity (R) gaming platform and participants were voluntarily recruited to assess highly immersive stereoscopic and less immersive desktop deliveries of the VLR. A validated survey tool was used to gather perceptions of both deliveries. Most participants agreed that both VLR deliveries were interesting and engaging and provided an immersive experience. Anatomy students perceived the stereoscopic delivery to be significantly more useful for understanding (P = 0.013), while anatomy tutors perceived the desktop delivery as more useful. A degree of physical discomfort and disorientation was reported by some participants for both deliveries, although to a greater extent for the stereoscopic delivery. The stereoscopic delivery was also found to be more mentally taxing than desktop delivery. These results suggest that desktop VLR delivery may minimize the risk of discomfort and disorientation associated with more immersive modalities while still providing a valuable learning experience.

AB  - One challenge while learning scientific concepts is to select relevant information and to integrate different representations of the learning content into one coherent mental model. Virtual reality learning environments (VRLEs) offer new possibilities to support learners and foster learning processes. Whether learning in VR is successful, however, depends to a large extent on the design of the VRLE and the learners themselves. Hence, adding supportive elements in VRLEs, such as annotations, might facilitate the learning process by guiding attention and supporting the selection of relevant information. Additionally, the mapping of pictorial and verbal information is eased by these annotations. The beneficial effect of annotations is highly dependent on learners' intrinsic motivation as intrinsic motivation while learning also affects the information selection and visual search patterns. In our experimental study (N = 61), we compared two conditions: learning in a VRLE with or without annotations. We measured the learning outcome on three different levels (knowledge, comprehension, and application). Additionally, we investigated intrinsic motivation as a moderator for the effect of annotations on learning outcome. We found no significant main effect of annotations on learning outcome. The moderating effect of intrinsic motivation for annotations on the overall learning outcome was significant. Our results imply that learners are either intrinsically motivated or need additional support by annotations as these support the selection of relevant information in the VRLE and therefore enable them to learn successfully. Which type or quantity of annotations supports learning processes best needs to be explored in future research.

AB  - Virtual reality (VR) refers to an artificial environment which is experienced through sensory stimuli (such as sights and sounds) provided by a computer and in which one's actions partially determine what happens in the environment (Merriam-Webster.com Dictionary, Merriam-Webster, 2020). In recent years, VR is increasingly used in different fields, and its role in medical practice is expanding quickly (Darekar et al., 2015; Chirico et al., 2016). One important feature of VR technology is its reproducibility (Ramnanan and Pound, 2017; Cao and Cerfolio, 2019). Practitioners can rehearse a procedure on a virtual patient or simulated tissue as many times as they wish before performing it on real patients. In medical education, VR allows students to see through body tissues and visualize the underneath areas (Cao and Cerfolio, 2019; Yu et al., 2019; Siyar et al., 2020). Practice experience is an essential element in pharmacy education (Teramachi et al., 2018). It is effective in boosting students' communication skills and problem-solving skills, which are both crucial for the provision of patient-centered care in a team-based approach (Lang et al., 2019). Unfortunately, actual practice experience can be limited by various factors, such as the policies at attachment sites, patients' preference, and availability of teaching staff (Wartman, 2019; Shrestha et al., 2020). Therefore, institutions are looking for alternative channels for students to practice their skills. One strategy is to adopt simulated patient cases (Kurup et al., 2017; Willemsen-Dunlap et al., 2018; Silva et al., 2019). In this paper, we share our experience of using VR learning tools in pharmacy education in a Hong Kong university. We will discuss the opportunities, challenges, and suggestions for future development of VR in pharmacy education.

AB  - Digital technologies are changing the landscape of anatomy education. To reveal the trend of digital anatomy education across medical science disciplines, searches were performed using PubMed, EMBASE, and MEDLINE bibliographic databases for research articles published from January 2010 to June 2021 (inclusive). The search was restricted to publications written in English language and to articles describing teaching tools in undergraduate and postgraduate anatomy and pre-vocational clinical anatomy training courses. Among 156 included studies across six health disciplines, 35% used three-dimensional (3D) digital printing tools, 24.2% augmented reality (AR), 22.3% virtual reality (VR), 11.5% web-based programs, and 4.5% tablet-based apps. There was a clear discipline-dependent preference in the choice and employment of digital anatomy education. AR and VR were the more commonly adopted digital tools for medical and surgical anatomy education, while 3D printing is more broadly used for nursing, allied health and dental health education compared to other digital resources. Digital modalities were predominantly adopted for applied interactive anatomy education and primarily in advanced anatomy curricula such as regional anatomy and neuroanatomy. Moreover, there was a steep increase in VR anatomy combining digital simulation for surgical anatomy training. There is a consistent increase in the adoption of digital modalities in anatomy education across all included health disciplines. AR and VR anatomy incorporating digital simulation will play a more prominent role in medical education of the future. Combining multimodal digital resources that supports blended and interactive learning will further modernize anatomy education, moving medical education further away from its didactic history.

AB  - Researchers are increasingly exploring educational games in immersive virtual reality (IVR) environments to facilitate students' learning experiences. Mainly, the effect of IVR on learning outcomes has been the focus. However, far too little attention has been paid to the influence of game elements and IVR features on learners' perceived cognition. This study examined the relationship between game elements (challenge, goal clarity, and feedback) as pedagogical approach, features of IVR technology (immersion and interaction), and learners' perceived cognition (reflective thinking and comprehension). An experiment was conducted with 49 undergraduate students who played an IVR game-based application (iThinkSmart) containing mini games developed to facilitate learners' computational thinking competency. The study employed partial least squares structural equation modelling to investigate the effect of educational game elements and learning contents on learner's cognition. Findings show that goal clarity is the main predictor of learners' reflective thinking and comprehension in an educational game-based IVR application. It was also confirmed that immersion and interaction experience impact learner's comprehension. Notably, adequate learning content in terms of the organisation and relevance of the content contained in an IVR game-based application significantly moderate learners' reflective thinking and comprehension. The findings of this study have implications for educators and developers of IVR game-based intervention to facilitate learning in the higher education context. In particular, the implication of this study touches on the aspect of learners' cognitive factors that aim to produce 21st-century problem-solving skills through critical thinking.

AB  - Purpose There is only limited data on the application of virtual reality (VR) for the evaluation of temporal bone anatomy. The aim of the present study was to compare the VR environment to traditional cross-sectional viewing of computed tomography images in a simulated preoperative planning setting in novice and expert surgeons. Methods A novice (n = 5) and an expert group (n = 5), based on their otosurgery experience, were created. The participants were asked to identify 24 anatomical landmarks, perform 11 distance measurements between surgically relevant anatomical structures and 10 fiducial markers on five cadaver temporal bones in both VR environment and cross-sectional viewings in PACS interface. The data on performance time and user-experience (i.e., subjective validation) were collected. Results The novice group made significantly more errors (p < 0.001) and with significantly longer performance time (p = 0.001) in cross-sectional viewing than the expert group. In the VR environment, there was no significant differences (errors and time) between the groups. The performance of novices improved faster in the VR. The novices showed significantly faster task performance (p = 0.003) and a trend towards fewer errors (p = 0.054) in VR compared to cross-sectional viewing. No such difference between the methods were observed in the expert group. The mean overall scores of user-experience were significantly higher for VR than cross-sectional viewing in both groups (p < 0.001). Conclusion In the VR environment, novices performed the anatomical evaluation of temporal bone faster and with fewer errors than in the traditional cross-sectional viewing, which supports its efficiency for the evaluation of complex anatomy.

AB  - This study investigated the role of virtual reality (VR) in computer science (CS) education over the last 10 years by conducting a bibliometric and content analysis of articles related to the use of VR in CS education. A total of 971 articles published in peer-reviewed journals and conferences were collected from Web of Science and Scopus databases to conduct the bibliometric analysis. Furthermore, content analysis was conducted on 39 articles that met the inclusion criteria. This study demonstrates that VR research for CS education was faring well around 2011 but witnessed low production output between the years 2013 and 2016. However, scholars have increased their contribution in this field recently, starting from the year 2017. This study also revealed prolific scholars contributing to the field. It provides insightful information regarding research hotspots in VR that have emerged recently, which can be further explored to enhance CS education. In addition, the quantitative method remains the most preferred research method, while the questionnaire was the most used data collection technique. Moreover, descriptive analysis was primarily used in studies on VR in CS education. The study concludes that even though scholars are leveraging VR to advance CS education, more effort needs to be made by stakeholders across countries and institutions. In addition, a more rigorous methodological approach needs to be employed in future studies to provide more evidence-based research output. Our future study would investigate the pedagogy, content, and context of studies on VR in CS education.

AB  - The integration of immersive virtual reality (VR) in authentic science classrooms can result in a totally new learning experience for the students. However, the effect of such a learning experience on students' conceptual learning gains and their perceptions of the experience, while considering students' pre-existing science- and digital technologies-related attitudinal profiles, has not been explored to date. In this study, we have enacted a 90-min technology-enhanced inquiry-based intervention with high-school students (n = 107), on the topic of the Special Theory of Relativity in a Physics course, using a learning experience design, structured around an immersive VR simulation. Firstly, we aimed at examining students' attitudinal profiles and, secondly, at exploring the potential differences of those profiles in relation to conceptual learning gains and perceptions of the learning experience. A clustering analysis has revealed two attitudinal profiles: the low-attitudes profile (n = 48) included students with low science- and digital technologies-related attitudes, and the opposite for the high-attitudes profile (n = 59). Results from a 2 x 2 RM ANOVA indicated a statistically significant interaction between conceptual learning gains and attitudinal profiles. In addition, a one-way MANOVA test showed statistically significant differences between the two profiles in relation to students' perceptions of the learning experience, with the students of the high-attitude profile outperforming their counterparts. We discuss our findings, focusing on the implications of students' individual differences in learning and attitudes linked to the integration of immersive VR in inquiry-based instruction.

AB  - As post-secondary education migrates online, developing and evaluating new avenues for assessment in anatomy is paramount. Three-dimensional (3D) visualization technology is one area with the potential to augment or even replace resource-intensive cadaver use in anatomical education. This manuscript details the development of a smartphone application, entitled "Virtual Reality Bell-Ringer (VRBR)," capable of displaying monoscopic two-dimensional (2D) or stereoscopic 3D images with the use of an inexpensive cardboard headset for use in spot examinations. Cadaveric image use, creation, and pinning processes are explained, and the source code is provided. To validate this tool, this paper compares traditional laboratory-based spot examination assessment stations against those administered using the VRBR application to test anatomical knowledge. Participants (undergraduate, n = 38; graduate, n = 13) completed three spot examinations specific to their level of study, one in each of the modalities (2D, 3D, laboratory) as well as a mental rotation test (MRT), Stereo Fly stereotest, and cybersickness survey. Repeated measures ANCOVA suggested participants performed significantly better on laboratory and 3D stations compared to 2D stations. Moderate to severe cybersickness symptoms were reported by 63% of participants in at least one category while using the VRBR application. Highest reported symptoms included: eye strain, general discomfort, difficulty focusing, and difficulty concentrating. Overall, the VRBR application is a promising tool for its portability, affordability, and accessibility. Due to reported cybersickness and other technical limitations, the use of VRBR as an alternative to cadaveric specimens presents several challenges when testing anatomy knowledge that must be addressed before widespread adoption.

AB  - Mixed-reality technology is a powerful tool used in healthcare and medical education to engage students in life-like scenarios. This blend of virtual and augmented reality images incorporates virtual projections with the real environment to allow real-time observation and interaction [1]. While this immersive technology offers advantages over cadaver dissections, it creates new challenges to keeping students engaged [2, 3]. Student engagement improves students' commitment to learning, critical thinking, and motivation and results in successful course outcomes [4, 5]. This paper provides an activity model using the HoloLens mixed-reality technology to deliver human gross anatomy laboratory sessions to first-year osteopathic medical students. The activity was designed using Gagne's model for instructional design and team-based learning to create an active learning model, which targets the behavioral, emotional, and cognitive dimensions of student engagement [6, 7]: behavioral engagement through autonomy and time on task, emotional engagement through providing the guiding exploration and narrative flow to accompany students' visual experience, and cognitive engagement by incorporating team-based learning (TBL) and case-based learning (CBL). The instructional model also answers the call for a new type of virtual reality instructor and pedagogical strategy that addresses the unique challenges and increases student engagement with this new technology. The effectiveness of this classroom activity was assessed by observing students for indicators or behaviors of student engagement, which are discussed. Further studies are required to measure the extent to which these indicators were exhibited and compare student engagement with this mixed-reality to didactic cadaver-based laboratory sessions.

AB  - The paper considers virtual reality (VR) as an effective way of teaching and learning. It discusses the possibilities of modern educational information technologies implementation, the educational advantages and drawbacks of 3D technologies and highlights VR features which enable dynamic forms of learning by creating artifacts in virtual environment with activities triggered by learners' interaction. The effective role of the means of VR in education is determined and theoretically substantiated. Approaches aimed at increasing the theoretical and practical readiness of learners for educational activity using VR tools are considered.
   The research participants were exposed to two learning modes: traditional (textbook style) and VR. The experiment was based on Human Anatomy VR Complete Edition by Virtual Medicine software which provided interaction with virtual models of human anatomy. Anatomy knowledge test and Students' Engagement in School Four-dimensional Scale were used to compare learning outcomes and the levels of student cognitive engagement between the two groups on the basis of ANOVA test.
   Participants in the VR mode improved learning performance (i.e. recollecting and reconstituting) and engagement scores (cognitive and agency subscales) compared to those in the traditional learning mode. Emotional self-ratings before and after the learning phase in the VR mode showed an increase in positive emotions and a decrease in negative emotions. Overall, participants in the VR mode displayed an improved learning experience when compared to traditional learning methods. The combination of visualization and interactivity makes VR learning mode advantageous for effective education. The directions of further research such as organizational and psycho-pedagogical conditions of VR implementation in education and teacher training are defined.

AB  - Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) can engage multiple senses more intensely than traditional trainings. Furthermore, physical laws can be suspended, extreme situations experienced in a risk-free manner, and learners can be provided contextual information as an overlay to reality. The ARSuL-Project ("Augmented Reality Based Support for Learning in the Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning Industry") aims to promote the development and evaluation of AR/VR-based support functions and learning offers for craft enterprises and their employees. First prototypes and demonstrators were evaluated in a comparative setup with apprentices and trained workers. In this paper, exemplary test results of the evaluation are presented, addressing knowledge gain, learning success, and the subjects' experience. In addition, problems, as reported by the participants and also improvement that they suggested will be outlined and cross-checked with conclusions from an analysis of the ARSuL AR/VR design elements with regards to their conformity with the principles of the Universal Design for Learning (UDL) framework.

AB  - The main objective of this study is to determine whether boys and girls learn better when the characteristics of the pedagogical agent are matched to the gender of the learner while learning in immersive virtual reality (VR). Sixty-six middle school students (33 females) were randomly assigned to learn about laboratory safety with one of two pedagogical agents: Marie or a drone, who we predicted serve as a role models for females and males, respectively. The results indicated that there were significant interactions for the dependent variables of performance during learning, retention, and transfer, with girls performing better with Marie (d = 0.98, d = 0.67, and d = 1.03; for performance, retention, and transfer, respectively) and boys performing better with the drone (d = -0.41, d = -0.45, d = -0.23, respectively). The results suggest that gender-specific design of pedagogical agents may play an important role in VR learning environments.

AB  - Until sufficient practical experience and documented examples are available, emerging technological methods to create educational content typically require in-depth knowledge from different fields in order to apply them in the most beneficial way. The method of creating photorealistic 3D models (PR3DMs) of real-world objects with the methods of photogrammetry is an example of such emerging technologies. This paper discusses the fundamental concepts of photogrammetry to provide an overview of the necessary basic knowledge for educators and researchers interested in the presentation of realistic virtual materials. Additionally, a deeper introduction to basic psychological processes while learning with photorealistic materials is presented. This provides deeper insights into potentials and issues, as well as an overview of the most crucial research gaps in learning with PR3DMs. Finally, current and future applications, as well as the potential for learning topics apart from factual knowledge, such as emotional or behavioral outcomes, are discussed.

AB  - The extension of technology in current society has encouraged teachers to introduce products based on VR and IVR in their classrooms, especially video games. In this paper the specific role of video games in cultural heritage and history teaching is analyzed. Moreover, the results of recent research on the application of video games in Secondary Education is discussed. The results advocate taking into account principles such as Civic Education, Historical Relevance, Engagement, Applicability and Multimodality (what has been called the CREAM Model) in the design of a video game. These principles are especially important if the video game aims to introduce archaeological and/or historical contents into the classroom. This model has been implemented in the design of the IVR video game Carthago Nova, which is discussed as an exemplar of how the proposed principles can be engaged. The educational sequence, in which the video game is contextualized, reinforces its educational aims.

KW  - INQUIRY
KW  - TECHNOLOGY
AB  - Immersive virtual reality (IVR) is regarded as one of the contemporary technological innovations with rich educational potential. As a subset of IVR, spherical video-based IVR (SV-IVR) immerses users centrally in a human-recorded real-world environment, allowing them to explore the environment in any directions via mobile phones and cardboard goggles. We have proposed a pedagogical framework-Learner-Immersed Virtual Interactive Expedition (LIVIE), which leverages SV-IVR to integrate immersive and interactive virtual inquiry-based fieldwork into learning and teaching of physical geography. Besides discussing the design of LIVIE, this paper reports on the quasi-experimental study that we carried out to evaluate its pedagogical effectiveness. The research subjects were 566 students from upper, middle and lower academic-category secondary schools in Hong Kong. The study showed that LIVIE had different degrees of positive effects on the high, moderate and low academic-achieving subjects. Our work not only provides evidence for supporting wider adoption of LIVIE in geography education, but it also sheds light on how to design and implement the pedagogical use of SV-IVR in school education.

AB  - In this mixed-method study, we investigated the impact and design of a multiuser, virtual reality (VR) supported teaching simulation, in comparison with live classroom teaching simulation, on the participatory training of teaching and the teaching knowledge development of student instructors. A total of 40 university teaching assistants participated in a 4-h training session in which they were randomly assigned to a VR simulation or a live classroom simulation condition. The study indicated that the VR simulation better promoted the lab-teaching knowledge development than the live simulation, whereas the latter better fostered class-teaching knowledge development. All participants reported higher teaching self-efficacy after the training. The qualitative data indicated that domain-specific challenges and authentic environmental prompting in the VR simulation fostered both experiential and vicarious learning of teaching. However, VR participants lacked mutual engagement in collaborative role-playing. The study findings suggest that VR-based simulation can supplement and work as an alternative to the live classroom simulation to host participatory teaching development.

AB  - With the growing pervasiveness of Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, Mixed Reality and Digital Twins combined with Artificial Intelligence, 5G networks and the omni-present 2D Web, we are entering into a new era, characterized by a multi-modal entangled combination of previously disparate realms of IT with human and social cognitive systems. This process of entanglement is arguably leading to a new, qualitatively different kind of reality, in which the borders between the physical and digital world, as well as digital representations and simulations thereof are becoming increasingly fuzzy. Based on these developments, the paper re-interprets some well-known concepts - including virtual reality, augmented reality, mixed reality, as well as virtual / digital simulations and virtual / digital twins. Based on these new interpretations, the paper introduces the higher-level structures of Digital Reality (DR) and Internet of Digital Reality (IoD). It is argued that these structures can lead to a better understanding of the new possibilities afforded to humanity by pervasive digital technologies.

AB  - With the goal of providing optimal care to patients, student-centered active learning and the development of clinical competency have become vital components of the education of future physicians capable of sustainably coping with future challenges. However, the shape of future medicine is dramatically changing based on advances in information and communication technology, and the current classroom model seems to have difficulties in fully preparing students for the future of medicine. New trends in teaching and assessment methods include computer-aided instruction, virtual patients, augmented reality, human patient simulations, and virtual reality for the assessment of students' competency. The digital technologies introduced in medical and dental education include Google Forms to collect students' answers, YouTube live-streaming, google art & culture (an online art museum), and choose-your-own-adventure as a story-telling technique. Innovations in digital technology will lead the way toward a revolution in medical and dental education, allowing learning to be individualized, interactive, and efficient.

AB  - This research aims to explore the latent effect of elementary student engagement in a Spherical Video-based Virtual Reality (SVVR) environment for a school-based course on higher level competence development. Student engagement and higher level competence development were investigated using a valid sample of 324 students from five elementary schools in China. Factor analysis and Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) were used to analyze the data. The ?tness of the items for each scale of the student engagement survey and higher level competence development survey indicated a suf?cient ?t and also con?rmed the questionnaire's structure. The relevant factors of student engagement promote their higher level competence development in the model. The SEM analysis shows that student engagement has a significant positive impact on higher level competence development. The findings could be a good reference for those who intend to develop a specific topic of school-based courses on technology for fostering students' higher level competence development.

AB  - Science achievement gaps exhibit racial disparities starting in primary grades and have been shown to persist through middle and high school. In turn, increasing positive attitudes toward science have been shown as one factor that affects academic achievement and motivation among K-12 students. Exploring novel ways that technology can influence diverse students' attitudes toward science, and the design elements pertinent therein, is thus one prominent goal toward achieving science education for all. Leveraging the immersive nature of Virtual Reality 360 videos, we present a design-based research iteration testing how a novel technology-enhanced learning experience influenced close to 400 urban elementary students' attitudes toward science. Using a two-way MANCOVA analysis, the data support that our design iteration emphasizingcontext-specific learningcan prime students that do not see science as relevant to them to change these attitudes in significantly positive ways. Implications are discussed around relationality, technology use in urban schools, and local contexts as learning resources.

AB  - Virtual reality (VR) is a powerful technological framework that can be considered as comprising any kind of device that allows for 3D environments to be simulated and interacted with via a digital interface. Depending on the specific technologies used, VR can allow users to experience a virtual world through their different senses, i.e., most often sight, but also through touch, hearing, and smell. In this paper, it is argued that a key impediment to the widespread adoption of VR technology today is the lack of interoperability between users'' existing digital life (including 2D documents, videos, the Web, and even mobile applications) and the 3D spaces. Without such interoperability, 3D spaces offered by current VR platforms seem empty and lacking in functionality. In order to improve this situation, it is suggested that users could benefit from being able to create dashboard layouts (comprising 2D displays) for themselves in the 3D spaces, allowing them to arrange, view and interact with their existing 2D content alongside the 3D objects. Therefore, the objective of this research is to help users organize and arrange 2D content in 3D spaces depending on their needs. To this end, following a discussion on why this is a challenging problem-both from a scientific and from a practical perspective-a set of operations are proposed that are meant to be minimal and canonical and enable the creation of dashboard layouts in 3D. Based on a reference implementation on the MaxWhere VR platform, a set of experiments were carried out to measure how much time users needed to recreate existing layouts inside an empty version of the corresponding 3D spaces, and the precision with which they could do so. Results showed that users were able to carry out this task, on average, at a rate of less than 45 s per 2D display at an acceptably high precision.

AB  - Study Objective: To estimate the effect of a virtual reality (VR) anatomic model (VisCubeSX; VisBox, Inc., Saint Joseph, IL) on obstetrics and gynecology residents' knowledge of female pelvic floor anatomy compared with a traditional curriculum.
   Design: Randomized controlled trial (Canadian Task Force classification I).
   Setting: Academic obstetrics and gynecology resident training program.
   Interventions: Traditional independent study curriculum versus traditional curriculum and VisCubeSX VR curriculum
   Measurements and Main Results: Residents were randomized, stratified by year of training, in a 1:1 fashion to traditional independent study curriculum for pelvic anatomy versus traditional curriculum and the VisCubeSX VR anatomic model. Tests were administered to assess baseline and postintervention knowledge. A postintervention assessment of the VisCubeSX VR anatomic model was performed. Baseline, follow-up, and score improvement were compared between groups using Student t tests and Wilcoxon rank sum tests. Thirty-one residents were randomized. There was a significant improvement in pre- and post-test scores within traditional independent study curriculum participants, 8.1 +/- 12.0 points (p = .02), and the VisCubeSX group 8.7 +/- 6.4 points (p < .001), but these improvements did not differ between groups (p = .86). This lack of between-group differences was consistent in resident year-stratified analyses. Residents exposed to the VisCubeSX VR anatomic model reported they "somewhat" or "strongly agree" (15/16 [93.8%] and 14/16 [87.5%] of residents, respectively) that the model improved their knowledge of pelvic anatomy and that the model will improve patient care.
   Conclusion: Few studies exist that compare educational outcomes of a traditional independent study of female pelvic anatomy curriculum versus immersive simulation with VR models in female pelvic anatomy. Knowledge scores were not significantly increased with the VR model compared with traditional curriculum, but VR technology was perceived as an enhancement to short-term learning. (C) 2018 AAGL.

AB  - Scaffolding is a mechanism for helping novice learners to solve a problem or complete a task that is beyond their current skill set. Prior research on immersive virtual reality (IVR) environments with scaffolding has mainly focused on the effectiveness of scaffolding for conceptual understanding and information processing. However, research on defining guidelines for designing computer-based scaffolds for IVR is scarce. To fill this gap, some recommendations are provided in this paper on how to design scaffolds for IVR environments for teaching English as a Foreign Language (EFL). An eye-tracking study was conducted with N = 41 university students from three EFL courses that used two versions of an IVR application for learning and practicing prepositions of place in English with different scaffolding mechanisms and in different contexts: a context in which the participant can move through the virtual space and a context in which the participant remains seated. A comparative analysis was conducted to determine which scaffolds were more appropriate for learning in IVR. This study extends previous research on scaffolding in IVR environments by suggesting some empirical evidence, collected from eye-tracking, of the effectiveness of different types of scaffolds in IVR environments and some design guidelines are provided. The results showed that scaffolds that are naturally embedded in the IVR environment and are closer to the objects that students need to interact with, are more effective for increasing their learning performance. Practical implications of this study for instructional designers and developers include: scaffolds should be designed considering the spatial contiguity principle and should be naturally blended with the VR environment. Scaffolds should direct students attention to the most important information and scaffolds can be provided in different forms (text, images and on-site indicators).

AB  - Virtual reality (VR) which is the world's state-of-the-art learning technology, is an innovative way of teaching students anything and increasing their attention. Students enter to an educational adventurous world through special headphones and devices. VR labs that contain this technology, expand the borders of schools, affordably. Cost of research centers such as science laboratories which are today, considered as luxury, decreases by means of VR labs and VR technologies inside those labs. Since VR technology is based on computers which are already present at schools, it is possible to increase students' success on a large scale for every school. The most important gains of VR labs are savings of time and space. Students who use VR as an educational tool, explore unreluctantly, adjust to studies easily and subjects of education quickly. VR systems which provides a real time virtual learning environment, offers simulation scenarios to improve students' problem solving and analytical skills. By means of these systems students will be able to solve problems through researcher and cooperative experimental activities. Scenarios are being developed in accordance with current math and science classes by using games and digital modelling. Students can use these systems to quickly interact with anyone and share their ideas and experiences. VR systems can also help students develop their language skill by encouraging them to participate in discussions, speeches open to general public, live audio communications and broadcastings. For students to receive feedback and have more time will have a positive contribution to their studies. Starting from this point of view VR technology is at the center of the study. By using gamified learning analyze through VR technology, some important data will be presented about the development of VR technology as a new media application of the future.

AB  - Background Virtual reality (VR) is an innovation that permits the individual to discover and operate within three-dimensional (3D) environment to gain practical understanding. This research aimed to examine the general efficiency of VR for teaching medical anatomy. Methods We executed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled studies of the performance of VR anatomy education. We browsed five databases from the year 1990 to 2019. Ultimately, 15 randomized controlled trials with a teaching outcome measure analysis were included. Two authors separately chose studies, extracted information, and examined the risk of bias. The primary outcomes were examination scores of the students. Secondary outcomes were the degrees of satisfaction of the students. Random-effects models were used for the pooled evaluations of scores and satisfaction degrees. Standardized mean difference (SMD) was applied to assess the systematic results. The heterogeneity was determined by I-2 statistics, and then was investigated by meta-regression and subgroup analyses. Results In this review, we screened and included fifteen randomized controlled researches (816 students). The pooled analysis of primary outcomes showed that VR improves test scores moderately compared with other approaches (standardized mean difference [SMD] = 0.53; 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 0.09-0.97, p < 0.05; I-2 = 87.8%). The high homogeneity indicated that the studies were different from each other. Therefore, we carried out meta-regression as well as subgroup analyses using seven variables (year, country, learners, course, intervention, comparator, and duration). We found that VR improves post-intervention test score of anatomy compared with other types of teaching methods. Conclusions The finding confirms that VR may act as an efficient way to improve the learners' level of anatomy knowledge. Future research should assess other factors like degree of satisfaction, cost-effectiveness, and adverse reactions when evaluating the teaching effectiveness of VR in anatomy.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore the effects of virtual reality (VR) application on creative performance and immersion, evaluated through electroencephalography brain wave data to achieve accurate and robust results. In this study, 72 middle school teachers were recruited as participants, and a non-randomized control-group pre-test-post-test design was employed. The experimental group received VR-based design instruction, and the control group received lecture-based design training. Our results revealed that VR significantly affects immersion, especially with regard to attention. Additionally, VR had a positive effect on the feasibility of the creative process, although its effects on variety and novelty were inconclusive. VR was significantly correlated with theta, beta, and gamma brain wave activity. VR also increased attention-related and meditation-related brain wave activity and desynchronized alpha waves. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic VR is used in many areas. VR in education is getting more important day after day. What this paper adds VR significantly affects immersion, especially with regard to attention. VR had a positive effect on the feasibility of the creative process, although its effects on variety and novelty were inconclusive. VR was significantly correlated with theta, beta, and gamma brain wave activity. VR also increased attention-related and meditation-related brain wave activity and desynchronized alpha waves. Implications for practice and/or policy User lack of familiarity with VR may also have influenced the results; more VR learning materials should be provided for learners. In addition to using a larger sample, future studies should focus on creative novelty when developing VR content to improve creative processes and outcomes. Familiarizing learners with the use of VR could effectively reduce the cognitive load, as well as contribute to the stimulation of creative brain waves.

AB  - There is great potential in making assessment and learning complementary. In this study, we investigated the feasibility of developing a desktop virtual reality (VR) laboratory simulation on the topic of genetics, with integrated assessment using multiple choice questions based on item response theory (IRT) and feedback based on the cognitive theory of multimedia learning. A pre-test post-test design was used to investigate three research questions related to: (1) students' perceptions of assessment in the form of MC questions within the VR genetics simulation; (2) the fit of the MC questions to the assumptions of the partial credit model (PCM) within the framework of IRT; and (3) if there was a significant increase in intrinsic motivation, self-efficacy, and transfer from pre- to post-test after using the VR genetics simulation as a classroom learning activity. The sample consisted of 208 undergraduate students taking a medical genetics course. The results showed that assessment items in the form of gamified multiple-choice questions were perceived by 97% of the students to lead to higher levels of understanding, and only 8% thought that they made the simulation more boring. Items within a simulation were found to fit the PCM and the results showed that the sample had a small significant increase in intrinsic motivation and self-efficacy, and a large significant increase in transfer following the genetics simulation. It was possible to develop assessments for online educational material and retain the relevance and connectedness of informal assessment while simultaneously serving the communicative and credibility-based functions of formal assessment, which is a great challenge facing education today.

AB  - Virtual and augmented reality have seen increasing employment for teaching within medical and health sciences programs. For disciplines such as physiology and anatomy, these technologies may disrupt the traditional modes of teaching and content delivery. The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to evaluate the impact of virtual reality or augmented reality on knowledge acquisition for students studying preclinical physiology and anatomy. The protocol was submitted to Prospero and literature search undertaken in PubMed, Embase, ERIC, and other databases. Citations were reviewed and articles published in full assessing learning or knowledge acquisition in preclinical physiology and anatomy from virtual or augmented reality were included. Of the 919 records found, 58 eligible articles were reviewed in full-text, with 8 studies meeting full eligibility requirements. There was no significant difference in knowledge scores from combining the eight studies (626 participants), with the pooled difference being a non-significant increase of 2.9 percentage points (95% CI [-2.9; 8.6]). For the four studies comparing virtual reality to traditional teaching, the pooled treatment effect difference was 5.8 percentage points (95% CI [-4.1; 15.7]). For the five studies comparing augmented reality to traditional teaching, the pooled treatment effect difference was 0.07 (95% CI [-7.0; 7.2]). Upon review of the literature, it is apparent that educators could benefit from adopting assessment processes that evaluate three-dimensional spatial understanding as a priority in physiology and anatomy. The overall evidence suggests that although test performance is not significantly enhanced with either mode, both virtual and augmented reality are viable alternatives to traditional methods of education in health sciences and medical courses.

AB  - Purpose Social determinants of health (SDOH) significantly impact individuals' engagement with the healthcare system. To address SDOH-related oral health disparities, providers must be equipped with knowledge, skills, and attitudes (KSAs) to understand how SDOH affect patients and how to mitigate these effects. Traditional dental school curricula provide limited training on recognizing SDOH or developing empathy for those with SDOH-related access barriers. This study describes the design and evaluation of such a virtual reality (VR)-based simulation in dental training. We hypothesize the simulation will increase post-training KSAs.
   Methods We developed "MPATHI" (Making Professionals Able THrough Immersion), a scripted VR simulation where participants take the role of an English-speaking caregiver with limited socioeconomic resources seeking dental care for a child in a Spanish-speaking country. The simulation is a combination of 360 degrees video recording and virtual scenes delivered via VR headsets. A pilot was conducted with 29 dental residents/faculty, utilizing a pre-post design to evaluate effectiveness in improving immediate and retention of KSAs toward care delivery for families facing barriers.
   Results MPATHI led to increased mean scores for cognitive (pre = 3.48 +/- 0.80, post = 4.56 +/- 0.51, p < 0.001), affective (pre = 4.20 +/- 0.4, post = 4.47 +/- 0.44, p < 0.001), and skill-based learning (pre = 4.00 +/- 0.47, post = 4.52 +/- 0.37, p < 0.001) immediately post-training. There was not a significant difference between skills measured immediately post-training and in the 1-month post-training survey (p = 0.41). Participants reported high satisfaction with the content and methods used in this training.
   Conclusions This pilot study supports using VR SDOH training in dental education. VR technology provides new opportunities for innovative content design.

AB  - Providing excellent and rich students' learning experience is a challenge that most distance Higher Education Institutions face, due to the distance nature of students' interaction with tutors, peers and content. Nonetheless, innovative and emerging technologies can be a powerful enabler in providing authentic and immersive students' learning experience and in preventing students' feelings of isolation and alienation, especially in distance education. For this reason, the newly established Laboratory of Educational Material and Methodology (LEMM) of the Open University of Cyprus (OUC) developed a long-term plan, in which emerging technologies are utilized through a student-centered, interactive course learning design methodology, in order to enhance distance students' learning experience. In particular, this paper discusses the design and development of pilot implementations, in which LEMM, in collaboration with the respective academic staff, integrated emerging technologies such as augmented and virtual reality, digital games, scenario-based simulations and automated assessment tools, in OUC courses. These pilot implementations offer valuable insights regarding LEMM's ongoing long-term plan of integrating emerging technologies in OUC's teaching, learning and assessment.

AB  - As a result of the COVID-19 disruption experienced in Spring 2020 many institutions had to close their doors and move their courses online. Our team used an existing set of virtual reality (VR) organic chemistry laboratory experiences developed for students with accessibility challenges as an online replacement for the face-to-face Organic Chemistry I laboratory. Although the materials used had been tried with a limited number of distance education students prior to their wide release, some technical challenges were experienced due to the large scale of the class, such as the inability to provide VR viewers for all the students enrolled, and lack of student access to reliable wifi for streaming videos after moving off-campus. In addition to technical difficulties, students experienced attitude challenges due to the global pandemic conditions and a very fast change from face-to-face instruction to online delivery of materials. This paper describes how these circumstances were overcome in order to finish the course, and how the VR experiences were shared with other institutions in an open access model.

AB  - Redundancy effect has been investigated in many controlled experimental studies, however, it is seldom investigated whether the same redundant material may cause different results in classroom, which is a major learning place for students. Considering that it is not easy to control the internal validity in classroom environment, this study proposed a new research approach with the use of virtual reality (VR) classroom as the experimental platform to investigate this issue. In the current study, one hundred and four fifth-grade students were randomly assigned to four experimental conditions with two different presentation formats (redundant and non-redundant) and two learning environments (lab and VR classroom). The retention test scores, cognitive load, and performance efficiency were used as dependent variables. The results revealed that the redundancy effect occurred in the lab environment and the reverse redundancy effect occurred in the VR classroom environment. In the lab environment, participants who had learned with non-redundant materials demonstrated better learning performance than those who had learned with redundant materials. On the contrary, the results were reversed in the VR classroom environment. The programmed interferences in the VR classroom are suggested as the main factor influencing the results.

AB  - The main advantage of Desktop Virtual Reality is that it enables learners to interact with each other both in the physical classroom and in a 3D environment. Even though, no explicit theories or models have been developed to contextualise Virtual Learning, instructional designers have successfully employed the traditional approaches with positive results on learners' motivation and engagement. However, there is very little we know when the question comes to the importance of examining and taxonomising the impact of interactions on motivation and engagement as a synergy of learners' concurrent presence. To evaluate the potential of interactions holistically and not just unilaterally, a series of experiments were conducted in the context of our Hybrid Virtual Learning classes underpinned from the instructional designer's decisions to increase the incentives for interactions. Learners' thoughts and preconceptions about the use of virtual worlds as an educational tool were surveyed, whilst, their actions and interactions (in both environments) were observed during their practical sessions. The take away is that the higher the levels of interactivity are, the higher the chances to attract students' attention and engagement with the process will be.

AB  - Purpose Reviews and meta-analyses concerning the effectiveness of extended reality technologies (ERTs) (namely virtual, augmented, and mixed reality-VR, AR, and MR) in anatomy education (AE) have resulted in conflicting outcomes. The current review explores the existing evidence provided by reviews of AE literature regarding the effectiveness of ERTs after their comparison with traditional (either cadaveric or two-dimensional) anatomy teaching modalities and sheds light on the factors associated with the conflicting outcomes. Methods PubMed, SCOPUS, ERIC, and Cochrane databases were searched for review articles with the purpose to investigate the effectiveness of ERTs in AE. Results Nine (four systematic with or without meta-analysis and five non-systematic) reviews were included. A lack of robust evidence provided by those reviews was noted, mainly due to a remarkable confusion in the definition of each ERT, along with confusion when authors referred to traditional AE (TAE) methods. Conclusions To clarify to what extent VR, AR, or MR can replace or supplement TAE methods, there is a primary need for addressing issues regarding the definition of each technology and determining which specific TAE methods are used as comparators.

AB  - Introduction: More and more educational institutions are discovering the advantages of settings for digital teaching and learning and the technology of virtual reality (VR). This also holds true for the BZ Pflege in the field of continuing education with age-heterogeneous groups of participants. The question arises whether baby-boomers and X and Y generation learners accept, understand and perceive the digital form of learning with VR glasses as beneficial for their learning.
   Project description: A course has been developed with the goal of teaching the anatomy of the heart by immersive visualisation. A questionnaire was used to determine how the use of VR glasses influenced participants` learning, acceptance, understanding and cognitive load.
   Results: The participants reacted positively to the VR technology. The new learning technology did not lead to cognitive overload. Participants indicated that they were able to link new knowledge with already existing knowledge. They also found the VR glasses easy to use.
   Conclusion: From the perspective of participants and project management alike, it can be said that age-heterogeneous groups present no obstacle for new innovative teaching methods, such as the use of VR glasses.

AB  - The introduction of online learning and interactive technology into tertiary education has enabled biomedical science and medical faculties to provide students with quality resources for off-campus study. This encompasses online self-directed learning, interactive blogs, quizzes, recordings of lectures and other resources. In addition, textbooks are now supplemented with interactive online learning tools, meaning that the student now has more accessibility than ever to engage with content. However, in biomedical sciences and medicine, technology has also enhanced the in-classroom experience. Anatomical and physiological visualisations in virtual, augmented and mixed reality provide students with an unprecedented ability to explore virtual content in-class, while learning remains structured by the facilitator and teaching team. This chapter will provide insights into the past use of technology to enhance off-campus learning, and then focus on the range of visualisations utilised within the laboratory or classroom in order to facilitate learning in biomedical sciences and medicine, including: augmented reality, virtual reality; mixed reality and Holograms; 3D printing; simulated dissections and anatomy simulation tables; and "Smart" tablets and touchscreen devices.

AB  - Background: With the availability and capabilities of varied technologically enhanced learning activities, the blended learning approach has become increasingly popular in interprofessional education. The combined use of different technologically enhanced learning activities has not been fully examined, particularly to determine the effects of instructional sequences for effective learning outcomes.
   Objective: The objective of this study was to investigate whether the instructional sequences of a blended learning approach can improve students' learning outcomes on interprofessional competencies.
   Methods: A randomized controlled study was conducted with 40 interprofessional health care teams. These teams undertook three technologically enhanced learning activities-Web-based instruction (WI), virtual reality (VR), and simulation exercise (SE)-after random assignment to three groups based on three different instructional sequences (WI-VR-SE, WI-SE-VR, and SE-WI-VR). Pretests and posttests were conducted to evaluate the students' learning outcomes on interprofessional competencies.
   Results: A total of 198 participants from the three groups completed the questionnaires All three groups reported significant improvement in their levels of self-efficacy (P<.05) and attitudes (P<.001) toward interprofessional team care about 1 month after the interprofessional learning activity. Although no significant difference was found (P = .0 6) between the WI-VR-SE and WI-SE-VR groups in the self-efficacy posttests, participants in the SE-WI-VR group reported significantly lower (P<.05) posttest scores than those in the WI-SE-VR group. The majority of the participants (137/198, 69.1%) selected the instructional sequence "WI-VR-SE" as their top preference.
   Conclusions: This study shows that the instructional sequence of a blended learning approach can have a significant impact on students' learning outcomes. The learning of concepts from WI followed by problem-solving activity in the SE was found to be a more effective learning sequence than the reverse sequence. We recommend that future studies focus on scaffolding students' learning when planning instructional sequences for technologically enhanced learning activities within blended learning environments.

AB  - In this systematic umbrella review we aggregate the current knowledge of how virtual and augmented reality technologies are applicable to and impact remote learning in higher education; specifically, how they impact such learning outcomes as performance and engagement in all stages of higher education from course preparation to student evaluation and grading. This review was done as part of a state wide research effort of Latvia, to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 and specifically to provide a framework for a technological transformation of education in this context. In this work we search the Scopus and Web of Science databases for articles describing the use of virtual and/or augmented reality technologies in remote learning for higher education and their impact on learning outcomes. We identified 68 articles from which, after multiple screening and eligibility phases, nine review articles were left for extraction phase in which 30 structural elements with corresponding interventions and measured effects were extracted. Of these, 24 interventions had a measured effect on student performance (11 positive, seven negative, six no impact) and six interventions had a measured effect on student engagement (all six positive).

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic and mandatory social distancing has brought challenges to anatomy educators who generally need in-person classes. The purpose of this study is to share the experience of a distant online lecture on a surgical procedure and related anatomy in a three-dimensional (3D) virtual reality (VR) workspace and to compare it with reported teaching methods, that is, an in-person class and a Zoom online class. The lecture was delivered by three authors of this article in a VR workspace that enables people to meet through VR. The lectures were about combinations of dental surgical procedures and related clinical anatomy. Physically, the attendees could have been located anywhere in the world, so lecturers joined from the United States and the attendees were all from Japan. VR environment and its flexibility enabled attendees to join the lecture actively, helping them to gain understanding of the surgical procedure and anatomy more efficiently. The use of VR technology with a live communication tool demonstrated in this study has several advantages over previous education methods, although there are still technical issues or disadvantages that need to be addressed. Development of the technology and app/software is required so that more data can be processed at higher speed. Use of VR technology with a live communication tool could be an alternative teaching method. Its overall advantages are a closer look at the slides/monitor and concurrent observation of the multiple assets in various directions by multiple attendees. These advantages cannot be achieved by any other teaching method without VR assets with the workspace provided by Spatial. Even during the mandatory social distancing due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this could enable us to foster 3D understanding of surgery and related anatomy. Further study is now needed to evaluate the effectiveness of this newly proposed teaching method by comparing it with traditional in-person and online classes with a live communication tool.

AB  - The development of three-dimensional learning among all K-12 student demographics remains a prominent goal for the field of science education. However, substantial research in science teacher education for urban populations showcases hurdles to overcome in order to achieve this goal, particularly for elementary teachers. Research shows that urban elementary teachers are often ill-prepared to develop a type of science pedagogy responsive to students' learning needs. The fidelity of such pedagogies that these teachers adhere to when trying to implement such a requested content-relationality between these populations and how their local contexts can be used as sites to learn science in relevant ways are often not fully realized, as well. Given that science achievement gaps exhibit racial disparities starting in primary grades and attitudes toward science have been shown to affect academic achievement and motivation, we argue that one way to ameliorate, in at least an incremental way, this disparity is to design novel learning experiences to prime students to see the relevancy of science in their local contexts before such three-dimensional designed learning is set to occur. In this research, we leveraged the immersive nature of Virtual Reality 360 videos and present a design-based research iteration testing how this novel technologically enhanced learning experience may have influenced close to 400 urban elementary students' attitudes toward science around those attitudes labeled as "behavioral beliefs" by the field. Using a concurrent, convergent mixed-methods design with a two-way multivariate analysis of covariance quantitative data set triangulated with students' qualitative self-reports that were transformed into quantitative preponderances in graphic form, the data support that our design iteration emphasizing the importance of context as a design focus can prime students who struggle to see science as relevant to change their attitudes. Implications are discussed around relationality, novel technological affordances, and the use of local contexts as learning resources.

Depending on the complexity of the space and the task at hand, this can he a difficult challenge. Nevertheless, the finding of useful viewpoints can be facilitated, at least in virtual reality, by changing the layout of the space, as well as by changing other visual features to lower the cognitive load of navigation. In this paper, we present a set of experiments using the MaxWhere desktop virtual environment which suggest that besides the arrangement of a space, its key points of discovery can also influence the time it takes to accomplish a task. This conclusion is supported both by data on key points of navigation and on the activation mode that was utilized on the various smartboards laid out in 3D space. In this research, we hope to show how specific nodes can be found, based on a data-oriented approach, which can lead users to focus on the most important information and obtain the best overview of any virtual space in general.

AB  - This study aimed to explore the neural correlates of the embodied metaphor "breaking the rules" and how it affects creativity by using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). To embody the metaphor "breaking the rules," we created a circumstance in which participants can experience "breaking the walls" through virtual reality (VR) technology. Participants were randomly assigned to three conditions: the "break-wall" condition, where they broke the walls to move forward; the "auto-wall" condition, where the barrier wall opened automatically; and the "no-wall" condition, where no barrier walls appeared. While walking in the virtual scenes, participants were asked to solve a creativity-demanding problem and to wear the fNIRS device to record their neural activities. It was found that participants showed better creative performance in the "break-wall" condition than in the other conditions. Weaker activations were found in the frontopolar cortex, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and the somatosensory association cortex under the "break-wall" condition, which may be associated with rule-breaking behaviors, creative performance, and sense of embodiment. These findings may indicate that physical actions of "breaking the wall" activate the conceptual metaphor of "breaking the rules," which triggers brain activities related to rule-breaking, thus affecting creative performance.

AB  - BackgroundRealistic, portable, and scalable lectures, cadaveric models, 2D atlases and computer simulations are being combined more frequently for teaching anatomy, which result in major increases in user satisfaction. However, although digital simulations may be more portable, interesting, or motivating than traditional teaching tools, whether they are superior in terms of student learning remain unclear. This paper presents a study in which the educational effectiveness of a virtual reality (VR) skull model is compared with that of cadaveric skulls and atlases. The aim of this study was to compare the results of teaching with VR to results of teaching with traditional teaching methods by administering objective questionnaires and perception surveys.MethodsA mixed-methods study with 73 medical students was conducted with three different groups, namely, the VR group (N=25), cadaver group (N=25) and atlas group (N=23). Anatomical structures were taught through an introductory lecture and model-based learning. All students completed the pre- and post-intervention tests, which comprised a theory test and an identification test. The theory test consisted of 18 multiple-choice questions, and the identification test consisted of 25 fill-in-the-blank questions.ResultsThe participants in all three groups had significantly higher total scores on the post-intervention test than on the pre-intervention test; the post-intervention test score in the VR group was not statistically significantly higher than the post-intervention test score of the other groups (VR: 30 [IQR: 22-33.5], cadaver: 26 [IQR: 20-31.5], atlas: 28[IQR: 20-33]; p>0.05). The participants in the VR and cadaver groups provided more positive feedback on their learning models than the atlas group (VR: 26 [IQR: 19-30], cadaver: 25 [IQR: 19.5-29.5], atlas: 12 [IQR: 9-20]; p<0.001).ConclusionsThe skull virtual learning resource (VLR) was equally efficient as the cadaver skull and atlas in teaching anatomy structures. Such a model can aid individuals in understanding complex anatomical structures with a higher level of motivation and tolerable adverse effects.

AB  - Personalized or precision education (PE) considers the integration of multimodal technologies to tailor individuals' learning experiences based on their preferences and needs. To identify the impact that emerging multimodal technologies have on personalized education, we reviewed recent implementations and applications of systems (e.g., MOOCs, serious games, artificial intelligence, learning management systems, mobile applications, augmented/virtual reality, classroom technologies) that integrate such features. Our findings revealed that PE techniques could leverage the instructional potential of educational platforms and tools by facilitating students' knowledge acquisition and skill development. The added value of PE is also extended beyond the online digital learning context, as positive outcomes were also identified in blended/face-to-face learning scenarios, with multiple connections being discussed between the impact of PE on student efficacy, achievement, and well-being. In line with the recommendations and suggestions that supporters of PE make, we provide implications for research and practice as well as ground for policy formulation and reformation on how multimodal technologies can be integrated into the educational context.

AB  - Research is presented that aims to determine the impact of the use of Immersive Virtual Reality (IVR), associated with manipulative/experiential activities based on the STEM approach, on the scientific-mathematical attitudes of 1st and 2nd year E.S.O. students, in a center located in a context of severe social exclusion. Through a mixed quantitative-qualitative methodological procedure, different instruments have been applied to a sample of 17 students and 1 teacher. The results indicate the existence of significant variations, together with an average effect size (ES), in attitudes towards learning science (p= ,000; ES= ,535), but not in the field of mathematics (p= ,887; ES= ,070). Likewise, there are significant improvements in the self-perception of learning the STEM contents addressed in the proposal (p= ,000; ES= ,944), a positive evaluation of the project by both students (9.9 out of 10) and by the teacher of the center's Science and Mathematics subjects (semistructured interview). It is concluded that the inclusion of this type of technologies positively impacts the scientific-mathematical attitudes of participating students.

AB  - This paper presents the results of the usability testing of an experimental component of the Virtual Collaboration Arena (VirCA) developed by the Cognitive Informatics Group of the Computer and Automation Research Institute of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. This component is a semi-intelligent agent called the Emotional Display Object. We applied Wizard-of-Oz type high-fidelity early prototype evaluation technique to test the concept. The research focused on basic usability problems, and, in general, the perceptibility of the object as uncovered by eye-tracking and interview data; we analyzed and interpreted the results in correlation with the individual differences identified by a demographic questionnaire and psychological tests: the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), the Spatial-Visual Ability Paper Folding Test, and the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) - however, the main goal of this paper outreaches beyond the particular issues found and the development of an agent: it shows a case study on how complex concepts in Virtual Reality (VR) can be tested in very early stage of development.

KW  - EDUCATION
AB  - The use of virtual laboratories is growing as companies and educational institutions try to expand their reach, cut costs, increase student understanding, and provide more accessible hands on training for future scientists. Many new higher education initiatives outsource lab activities so students now perform them online in a virtual environment rather than in a classroom setting, thereby saving time and money while increasing accessibility. In this paper we explored whether the learning and motivational outcomes of interacting with a desktop virtual reality (VR) science lab simulation on the internet at home are equivalent to interacting with the same simulation in class with teacher supervision. A sample of 112 (76 female) university biology students participated in a between-subjects experimental design, in which participants learned at home or in class from the same virtual laboratory simulation on the topic of microbiology. The home and classroom groups did not differ significantly on posttest learning outcome scores, or on self-report measures of intrinsic motivation or self-efficacy. Furthermore, these conclusions remained after accounting for prior knowledge or goal orientation. In conclusion, the results indicate that virtual simulations are learning activities that students can engage in just as effectively outside of the classroom environment.

AB  - Recently, Virtual Reality (VR) has developed rapidly. Some studies propose that VR has a great deal of potential as an instructional media for learning, while other studies indicate that VR may be ineffective or even negatively influence learners' learning experience. Few studies provide reference to educators or teachers based on empirical data. This study investigates 55 10th-grade learners' perceptions and presences in a VR-based blended learning environment. A research framework based on social presence theory and the Community of Inquiry model (CoI) was adopted in order to study social presence, teaching presence, and cognitive presence of learners in a VR-based practical, blended learning environment. The research findings are as follows: (1) VR enhanced learners' perception of the teaching equipment and the classroom, social presence, teaching presence. (2) VR-based blended learning can have a positive effect on the interest, attention, and interaction of learners. (3) For transferring well-structured knowledge, there is no significant difference between traditional instructional media and VR. But for transferring ill-structured knowledge, VR is more effective at promoting learning than traditional instructional media. In general, VR-based learning environments can positively affect students' perceptions and presence.

AB  - Background An increasing number of educational institutions are incorporating virtual reality (VR) applications in the instruction methodology for their laboratory science courses. However, there is debate about the use of the physical vs. the virtual lab as according to research the former offers a positive research-training environment, whereas the latter offers safe and repeated practice in combination with an engaging experience. Purpose This study explores whether virtualization applied to practically oriented education can: a) fulfill specific educational goals which correspond to the six levels of Bloom's Taxonomy, b) raise students' confidence about their knowledge and c) help students learn how to use an optical microscope in a physical biology lab. Sample Fifteen graduates of the Athens University Department of Primary Education in Greece attending postgraduate studies in Science Education. Methods The sample was separated into two cognitively balanced groups to be educated on microscopy by two educational methods: a) the traditional tutorial and demonstration method, and b) our proposed tutorial and simulation method with a VR biology lab, Onlabs. Participants completed both a Pre- and a Post-test to assess the acquired knowledge, and a worksheet to assess their ability to operate a real optical microscope. Results Participants in the experimental group obtained higher Post-test scores and were better educated to correctly answer different types of questions corresponding to Bloom's Taxonomy than were members of the control group. Moreover, when working in the physical lab after having used Onlabs, the experimental group was more knowledgeable about the required experimentation skills compared to the control group. Conclusion Our findings provided evidence in favor of using simulations. They pointed out that including simulations as a supplementary tool to the traditional face-to-face tutorials is a very promising prospective for grasping the details of laboratory knowledge, in a postgraduate program in Science Education.

AB  - Innovation is defined by a range of activities having different goals but driven by the same purpose. For example, in the ending phases, the aim will be to put forward precise concepts, while upstream of innovation, the activities are defined by the will to investigate the subject and increase the area of knowledge and concepts helpful for the conception of new products. This study takes place in the latter contexts because these are the ones where tools are the most variable and de facto, the least normalised. Our aim was to study user experience felt by the usage of these tools as well as their impact on creativity and ideas' communicability. To do this, we led an experimental study with 79 participants comparing four tools: pen & paper, Virtual-Reality (VR) drawing, VRCAD, and traditional CAD. Thanks to the UEQ (Laugwitz et al., 2008) and judges method of Cropley and Cropley (2008), we measured the user-exprience and the creativity. Then we compared the level of creativity, user-experience and communicability induced by each tool. The results reveal that the user experience arising from the tool influences the amount and the quality of the ideas. Moreover, we show that the fewer standardises interactions the tools have, the greater the communicability of ideas.

AB  - Experts show better mnemonic performance than novices, due to higher number of stored schemas, according to cognitive load theory. This advantage is hindered in non-optimal situations where experts' schemas are sometimes not applicable and may show same or higher cognitive load than novices. Further investigations were, however, needed to unravel the mechanisms at stake in real-life situations. We investigated expert train travelers in normal versus disturb condition using immersion in a virtual environment of a Parisian train station: Saint-Michel Notre Dame. Our aim was to determine how cognitive load varies according to expertise level of travelers. We measured skin conductance responses for physiological analysis, NASA-Task Load Index for subjective analysis, and factual and spatiotemporal contextual memory investigation for behavioral analysis. As expected, expert travelers showed lower cognitive load than novices in normal but not in disturb condition. In fact, an expertise reversal effect was observed in disturb context, characterized by higher cognitive load in experts for subjective and physiological measures, and a lower temporal memory performance. These alterations are believed to be associated with high cognitive load needed for inhibiting the automatized schemas. We provide a novel insight in expertise reversal effect, during navigation in an everyday life activity.

AB  - During an Information Architecture course at our university, students designed and created a system of e-health environments as a set of an e-health promotion services developed for a library and prepared in MaxWhere 3D virtual reality spaces. They had to define the goals of their environments, the target groups, they had to organize the pieces of information for having an impact on their future users. During the design process, they had to use their knowledge about marketing, psychology, information architecture and library and information science. Here we present three environments that were designed for using them in an imaginary library in 2025. One of them could be applied in the library of the Institute of Sport Science as well as of the Faculty of Public Health. This huge environment contains various topics in this area. The student applied many media types, online services and designed applications that probably will exist in the near future. An important point of view was to provide useful, important, reliable and up-to-date information for the users of the target group. The overall goal of the research was to develop some cognitive skills of the students: inventive and innovative thinking. In this paper, we demonstrate some results of this research: the design and development of the e-Health Promotion VR service.

AB  - Online learning is the preferred option for professional training, e.g. Industry 4.0 or e-health, because it is more cost efficient than on-site organisation of realistic training sessions. However, current online learning technologies are limited in terms of personalisation, interactivity and immersiveness that are required by applications such as surgery and pilot training. Virtual Reality (VR) technologies have the potential to overcome these limitations. However, due to its early stage of research, VR requires significant improvements to fully unlock its potential. The focus of this PhD is to tackle research challenges to enable VR for online training in three dimensions: (1) dynamic adaptation of the training content for personalised trainings, by incorporating prior knowledge and context data into self-learning algorithms; (2) mapping of sensor data onto what happens in the VR environment, by focusing on motion prediction techniques that use past movements of the users, and (3) investigating immersive environments with intuitive interactions, by gaining a better understanding of human motion in order to improve interaction. The designed improvements will be characterised though a prototype VR training platform for multiple use cases. This work will not only advance the state of the art on VR training, but also on online e-learning applications in general.

AB  - We aim to provide an overview of the various digital three-dimensional visualizations used for learning anatomy and to assess whether these improve medical students' understanding of anatomy compared to traditional learning methods. Furthermore, we evaluate the attitudes of the users of three-dimensional visualizations. We included articles that compared advanced newer three-dimensional anatomy visualization methods (i.e., virtual reality, augmented reality, and computer-based three-dimensional visualizations) to traditionalmethods that have been used for a long time (i.e., cadaver and textbooks) with regard to users' understanding of anatomy. Of the 1,148 articles identified, 21 articles reported data on the effectiveness of using three-dimensional visualization methods compared to two-dimensional methods. Twelve articles found that three-dimensional visualization is a significantly more effective learning method compared to traditional methods, whereas nine articles did not find that three-dimensional visualization was a significantly more effective method. In general, based on these articles, medical students prefer to use three-dimensional visualizations to learn anatomy. In most of the articles, using three-dimensional visualization was shown to be a more effective method to gain anatomical knowledge compared to traditional methods. Besides that, students are motivated and interested in using these new visualization methods for learning anatomical structures. (C) 2019Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Specimen observation and dissection have been regarded as the best approach to teach anatomy, but due to the severe lack of anatomical specimens in recent years, the quality of anatomy teaching has been seriously affected. In order to disseminate anatomical knowledge effectively under such circumstances, this study discusses three key factors (modeling, perception, and interaction) involved in constructing virtual anatomy teaching systems in detail. To ensure the authenticity, integrity, and accuracy of modeling, detailed three-dimensional (3D) digital anatomical models are constructed using multi-scale data, such as the Chinese Visible Human dataset, clinical imaging data, tissue sections, and other sources. The anatomical knowledge ontology is built according to the needs of the particular teaching purposes. Various kinds of anatomical knowledge and 3D digital anatomical models are organically combined to construct virtual anatomy teaching system by means of virtual reality equipment and technology. The perception of knowledge is realized by the Yi Chuang Digital Human Anatomy Teaching System that we have created. The virtual interaction mode, which is similar to actual anatomical specimen observation and dissection, can enhance the transmissibility of anatomical knowledge. This virtual anatomy teaching system captures the three key factors. It can provide realistic and reusable teaching resources, expand the new medical education model, and effectively improve the quality of anatomy teaching.

AB  - BACKGROUND Human cadavers are an essential component of anatomy education. However, access to cadaveric specimens and laboratory facilities is limited in most parts of the world. Hence, new innovative approaches and accessible technologies are much needed to enhance anatomy training.
   OBJECTIVE To provide a practical method for 3-dimensional (3D) visualization of cadaveric specimens to maximize the utility of these precious educational materials.
   METHODS Embalmed cadaveric specimens (cerebrum, brain stem, and cerebellum) were used. The 3D models of cadaveric specimens were built by merging multiple 2-dimensional photographs. Pictures were taken with standard mobile devices (smartphone and tablet). A photogrammetry program (Qlone (R), 2017-2020, EyeCue Vision Technologies Ltd, Yokneam, Israel), an all-in-one 3D scanning and augmented reality technology, was then used to convert the images into an integrated 3D model.
   RESULTS High-resolution 360-degree 3D models of the cadaveric specimens were obtained. These models could be rotated and moved freely on different planes, and viewed from different angles with varying magnifications. Advanced editing options and the possibility for export to virtual- or augmented-reality simulation allowed for better visualization.
   CONCLUSION This inexpensive, simple, and accessible method for creating 360-degree 3D cadaveric models can enhance training in neuroanatomy and allow for a highly realistic surgical simulation environment for neurosurgeons worldwide.

AB  - Virtual trainings are probably the most popular application of virtual reality (VR) in industry. Such applications are usually hand crafted by computer graphics experts, so generating new trainings is time-intensive and expensive. Even when a training application has been built, any subsequent changes require the inclusion of Software Developers and 3D modeling experts.
   In this paper, we propose a solution that separates these concerns and makes the generation of AR or VR/AR Training applications easier and cheaper. Our approach is based on a Business Process Model (BPM) of the task to be trained. For technical experts it is common to use such process models to describe tasks. Numerous BPM tools are available, and often models of tasks to be trained are already available. We thus present a compiler that directly translates such process models and a corresponding CAD Model of a machine to a ready-to-use VR/AR machine Training application. By feeding different process models to the compiler, different VR/AR Training applications can be generated quickly, without programming or 3D modeling expertise. We also show how knowledge about the possible interactions is exploitable within a particular training to optimize rendering and simulation performance, which allows us to generate VR/AR Training applications even for machines of high geometric complexity.

AB  - The learning through mobile applications (Apps) is a subject of great importance that is associated to interact with virtual reality. Despite the large number of Apps available, there is not enough information to guide the usefulness in the didactics of anatomy. That is why this work aims to evaluate the use of mobile applications in the study of human anatomy. Methods were sought for applications for the study of human anatomy, using the App Store and Google Play download platforms. Apps were prioritized giving importance to those that had a greater number of people who had valued it, and the score given by its users. Apps were added to the study of human anatomy in health students at universities in city of Manizales (Colombia). An instrument was applied to evaluate the usefulness in the learning of the different human structures. The search resulted in 113 applications of which 70 are free and 43 have a download cost. Of these, Anatomy quiz is the most preferred by students when studying anatomy. The use of Apps for the study of human anatomy prepares students to face a real structure; unlimited specimens are available for virtual dissection and to develop spatial skills. Knowing the Apps available for the study of the human body contributes to better didactics of anatomy.

AB  - Advances in consumer-level educational technologies show great promise for enhancing the learning experiences of students in health and medicine. There are particular benefits to using a combination of various devices and technologies when teaching challenging concepts. These include augmented reality-enabled devices enriched with accompanying 3D printed models, or virtual reality sessions coupled with online quizzes or revision activities. Tablet applications can also be integrated while students engage concurrently in desktop-based online learning. This mixing and merging of different technologies can allow educators to focus on the strengths of each device, while mitigating limitations arising from a single mode's stand-alone use. This chapter describes a series of options to integrate multiple digital modes when educating health science and medical students using technology. It also presents the opportunity for health professional program graduates to be trained in teaching using technology, as their future careers can be enhanced by an ability to educate effectively, or from the skills developed when incorporating innovations such as serious games into a health curriculum. With the dynamic and ever-changing nature of health and medical education, educators can find great benefits when introducing multimodal digital learning into their respective courses.

AB  - Speaking is a challenge for most English learners owing to the lack of practicing environments and partners. The virtual reality (VR) technology has changed this situation by providing learners with rich opportunities for practice. In VR-based practicing environments, peer tutoring is a common strategy for promoting peer assistance. However, in conventional VR-based learning, students may merely follow the guidelines and content provided by the teacher without thinking about the meaning and reasons for the practice in the situated contexts, which generally leads to poor learning outcomes. To solve this problem, a progressive question prompt-based peer-tutoring approach in VR contexts (PQP-PTVR) is proposed to assist students' English-speaking development. An experiment was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The experimental group used the proposed approach, while the control group learned with the conventional question prompt-based peer-tutoring approach in VR contexts (C-PTVR). The results showed that the experimental group achieved significantly greater improvement in speaking and self-efficacy than the control group. Concerning the participants' learning behaviors, the experimental group had more interactions and made more attempts to improve their speaking. This study contributes to the existing literature by proposing the PQP-PTVR approach to enhancing learners' speaking development, improving their interactions and self-efficacy.

AB  - Objective structured clinical examinations (OSCEs) have been widely used in health care education to simultaneously assess knowledge, skill and attitude. Due to the high cost of running an OSCE, its application in professional psychology is still limited. To solve this problem, virtual standardised patient (VSP) implementations in creating psychology OSCEs can be a cost-effective method for administering a psychology OSCE regularly. This study aimed to develop and examine the psychometric properties of the VSP version of the Intake OSCE (VSP-Intake OSCE) in measuring psychologists' psychological assessment competencies (PACs) from entry to early practice. The initial development of the VSP-Intake OSCE contains a VSP station and a follow-up written station to measure PACs when conducting an intake assessment. To administer the VSP station, we built a new VSP system that allows psychologists to interact with a VSP verbally. A sample of 36 participants, including 27 graduate students and nine psychologists, were recruited to examine the psychometric properties of the VSP-Intake OSCE. As a newly developed instrument, the VSP-Intake OSCE revealed good inter-rater reliability and construct validity. We believe using VSP implementations to develop psychology OSCEs will be essential in promoting OSCE applications in professional psychology.

AB  - The technological advancement and rapid development of artificial intelligence have led to a growing number of studies investigating pedagogical innovations incorporated with emerging technologies in this digital era. An increasing amount of empirical evidence has suggested the potential benefits of incorporating digital technologies and artificial intelligence in various educational contexts, such as the K-12 education, and a change in learning modality in the unprecedented period of COVID-19. In chemical education, various types of emerging technologies, such as eye-tracking techniques, learning analytics, robotics, virtual reality (VR), and augmented reality (AR), have seen wide applications and promising prospects. In this paper, a systematic review of emerging technologies adopted in chemical education during this era of digitalization and artificial intelligence is presented. The current study aims to identify the major types of technologies adopted in chemical education and analyze the empirical findings from relevant studies. A total of 45 studies between 2010 and 2021 were analyzed through a literature search in three inter-disciplinary databases: Web of Science, Scopus, and the Educational Information Resource Center. Full-text retrieval and analysis of the included studies were conducted. The present study finds that AR and VR applications were most extensively investigated among the identified types of technologies adopted in chemical education, while the major focus areas were associated with virtual chemistry laboratories, visualization and interaction with chemical structures, and classroom hands-on activities. The evidence presented in this study also indicates the promising applications of artificial intelligence and learning analytics in the analysis of students' feedback and behavior, assessment of students' understanding of chemical concepts, and investigations of students' reasoning and cognitive processes during chemical tasks such as spectral interpretation. Furthermore, areas requiring more research, investigations, potential future applications, as well as pedagogical implications of education for sustainable development will be identified based on the evidence presented in this study. The findings of this study are expected to give insight on the evolving areas of chemical education research and technology-enhanced teaching and learning.

AB  - Within medical education virtual reality (VR) environments have been used routinely for training and assessing medical skills whereas they remain less developed in other fields where knowledge of human anatomy may also be required. A full understanding of human anatomy requires students to learn many specific terms and typically traditional assessments in this area reward recall over contextual understanding. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine whether using VR as an immersive learning opportunity could help students to engage with anatomy material and subsequently whether it may impact their achievement in related assessments. Students studying a level 4 (first year undergraduate) anatomy module as part of a Medical Engineering undergraduate degree (N = 42) were recruited to the study. Data collection consisted of a crossover repeated-measures design where students completed an assessment of their knowledge of the skeletal system before and after using the VR platform and before and after studying from a set of written notes in a randomised order. Students also completed a questionnaire regarding their thoughts about the VR task and its part in their learning. Within the VR platform students completed and individual task where they were required to assemble a human skeleton using a controller and starting from the skull. They were given hints and tips throughout if needed and on completion were given a score based on their time to correctly assemble the skeleton and number of hints needed. Results of the study showed that students had a (non-significant, P = 0.141) improvement in their learning in the short-term (10 +/- 15%) over text book use alone (0% +/- 12%). In the longer term those who participated in the study performed significantly better on the end of module examination (P = 0.012) suggesting measurable learning gain from the experience more widely. Questionnaire results show that students felt VR belonged in higher education settings (100%) and that it helped their attainment on the end of module exam (71%). The main benefit students saw in using VR for this anatomy material was that it 'gave a clearer visual perception of the bones' (83%). The study concluded that students showed a measurable learning gain using a VR platform and that students want to see more VR in their higher education provision. Universities should consider facilitating VR platforms for appropriate educational material.

AB  - Enhancing students' creativity is one of the most important tasks in higher education. This is even more important in teacher training. Pre-service teachers have to learn not only how to be creative but they should also know how to encourage their future students to be creative.
   For developing students' creativity, we started to use some disruptive IT tools some years ago: eye tracking and virtual reality (VR). In a paper, we presented the results of a survey where we used an eye tracker and an eye tracking survey's results for enhancing the students' creativity and motivation in teacher training.
   In this paper we deal with the results of an experiment performed in a teacher training course: In this survey, we used a method for enhancing the students' creativity by applying VR workspaces of the MaxWhere immersive VR system.
   The VR spaces had two roles in this method:
   1 We used some VR environments for guiding the students through the course contents: the students could reach the course materials through these spaces. We offered collaborative methods for performing the courses' tasks, and for solving the problems and the homeworks during the courses. Students could collaborate through these spaces. These spaces demonstrated some techniques on how to use such a VR environment in a creative and collaborative way.
   2 We provided a MaxWhere VR space as a "white and empty page" for the students that they had to fill with course materials and collaborative points.
   The students had to choose a project theme from their professions. Each student had to evolve a working area for their students in this MaxWhere VR space. They had to design how to motivate their students to be creative and to be collaborative. Our university students had to implement such a working space, fill it with digital learning materials for their students, where their future students could learn and work in almost a fully self-paced way and could use their creative skills.
   In this research, we examined how the students can leave the cliches behind and can be creative in their tasks and in their working environment designs. Our experiences, the most positive outcomes, and some of the problems that have arisen are to be presented here.

AB  - Although intelligence beliefs have been applied to explain the influence of cognition, behavior, and creativity, the research on creativity is still limited. Therefore, in order to effectively expand the understanding of the influence of intelligence beliefs on the creative performance of learners' graphics, the implicit theories of intelligence were exploited as the basis of this study. Three hypothetical pathways were proposed to be explored, and a research model was validated. First- and second-year students from a technical high school in New Taipei City were invited to participate. There were 273 valid data (88.9% of complete data). Reliability and validity analyses were performed, as well as overall model fit analysis and research model validation, and descriptive statistical analysis of the learners' performance in applying the operational virtual reality (VR). The results of this study showed that: (1) Incremental beliefs of aesthetic intelligence had a positive effect on spatial performance; (2) entity belief of spatial intelligence (EBSI) had a negative effect on spatial performance; and (3) spatial performance had a positive effect on graphical design performance. From the results, it is clear that design teachers can assess students' implicit beliefs in the early stages of teaching to actively promote better spatial performance when students show high levels of entity beliefs.

AB  - For doctors and other medical professionals, the human body is the focus of their daily practice. A solid understanding of how it is built up, that is, the anatomy of the human body, is essential to ensure safe medical practice. Current anatomy education takes place either using text books or via dissecting human cadavers, with text books being the most traditional way to learn anatomy due to the cost of the alternatives. However, printed media offer only a 2D perception of a part of the human body. Although dissection of human cadavers can give a more direct observation and interaction with human bodies, it is extremely costly because of the need of preserving human bodies and maintaining dissection rooms. To solve this issue, we developed VeLight, a system with which students can learn anatomy based on CT datasets using a 3D Virtual Reality display (zSpace). VeLight offers simple and intuitive interactions, and allows teachers to design their own courses using their own material. The system offers an interactive, depth-perceptive learning experience and improves the learning process. We conducted an informal user study to validate the effectiveness of VeLight.

AB  - This chapter highlights our survey that identifies faculty recommendations for incorporating emerging digital technologies to deliver eLearning content in online courses that help students learn more effectively. Results from the survey, which includes a sample of 478 online faculty at two higher education institutions, are presented.
   In the findings of the survey, respondents identified several instructional technologies such as augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), mixed reality (MR), and artificial intelligence (AI) as being on the cusp of changing learner engagement options and could soon become standard tools for the online course environment. While respondents predict an acceleration of new technology activity, they also caution that these technologies need a strong pedagogical foundation to match student needs and generate new use-learning real case scenarios.
   This sentiment implies a more systematic approach to problem-solving that follows a process of identifying and refining multiple options to determine best practices for faculty preparation and staff development. The results of the survey included in this chapter are a directional means to help instructors and course designers explain what is relevant and exciting about techniques that can be employed and identify and use the emerging technological tools that enhance the delivery of instruction while meeting the ever-changing and dynamic needs of today's learners.

AB  - The aim of the research was to analyze the knowledge about the study of anatomy without dissecting in the cadaver or the material of fixed cadaveric pieces (FCP). Prospective, descriptive, observational cross-sectional research, through the use of a survey of Anatomy students of the LUZ School of Medicine, Maracaibo-Venezuela, during 2018. The survey was answered by 98% of the students (16.1 +/- 0.23 years), 78.0% of them were female. 95% recognized the cadaver or the PCF material as important, but had not had dissection practices, and 87.5% considered it important to dissect the cadaver or the PCF. Why they didn't dissect, 60% was due to lack of optimal cadavers; 25% do not have time for dissection say teachers; 15% teachers are not always prepared; and 10% defend the use of virtual reality technologies. 90% responded that being able to dissect was a very positive experience and 100% considered that the advantage was favoring three-dimensional understanding. In the case of disadvantages, 60% considered that the poor condition and smell was a major inconvenience, 30% reported difficulty in recognizing the structures, while 10% perceived it as a boring activity. In conclusion, the students considered the use of the cadaver or PCF adequate for learning human anatomy, however, they indicated that the use of computer resources does not seem to have an acceptance for the study of this discipline at the moment.

AB  - The introduction of interactive assets in public exhibitions is capable to significantly enhance the visitors' user experience. However, the creation of interactive applications could represent a challenging task, especially for users lacking computer skills. Visual programming languages (VPLs) - one of the instruments belonging to the broad categories of methods and tools devised to support end-user development (EUD) - promise to offer an intuitive way to overcome these limitations, by providing easy-to-use and efficient interfaces for encoding applications' logic. Moving from these considerations, this paper first analyses pros and cons of tools devised so far to support the generation of interactive contents. Then, it presents the design of a new tool named Visual Scene Editor (VSE), which allows users with little to no programming skills to create 3D interactive applications by combining available assets through an interactive, visual process. Both objective and subjective measurements have been collected with both skilled and unskilled users to evaluate the performance of the proposed tool. A comparison with existing solutions shows a reduction in the time required to complete the assigned tasks, of the complexity of the logic created, as well as of the number of errors made, confirming the suitability of the VSE for the said purpose.

AB  - Using virtual reality (VR) in educational settings is becoming increasingly popular. The feasibility of replacing an instrumentation-based organic chemistry lab with a VR experience has been evaluated. A VR laboratory experience was designed to teach students how to use an infrared spectrometer and elucidate an unknown structure from the resulting infrared spectrum. The resulting first-person VR experience is immersive and realistic, with a teaching assistant guiding the user along the steps required to complete the experiment, including feedback as needed. The VR experience was developed in WondaVR with selections made using gaze navigation. The resulting product was tested with a group of students, and the outcomes for short- and long-term recall were compared with a group of students that did the same experiment in a traditional lab. Results indicate that there are no significant differences in learning outcomes between the two groups, which indicates the possibility of using this tool to offer this organic chemistry lab experiment via distance education. Students that tried the VR experience reported a high degree of satisfaction with the product and no significant usability barriers. These VR experiences could be useful for students who are unable to be present in lab due to disabilities, attendance challenges such as pregnancy, or safety concerns.

AB  - Virtual reality and augmented reality have become increasingly prevalent in our lives. They are changing the way we see and interact with the world and have started percolating through medical education. In this article, we reviewed the key applications of virtual and augmented realities in neurology and neuroscience education and discussed barriers and opportunities for implementation in the curriculum. Although the long-term benefits of these approaches over more traditional learning methods and the optimal curricular balance remain mostly unexplored, virtual and augmented reality can change how we teach neurology and neuroscience.

AB  - The use of realistic visualizations has gained considerable interest due to the proliferation of virtual reality equipment. This review is concerned with the theoretical basis, technical implementation, cognitive effects, and educational implications of using realistic visualizations. Realism can be useful for learners, but in several studies, more abstract illustrations have resulted in higher performance. Furthermore, a preference for realistic visualization has been declared as being based on misconceptions regarding the cognitive system. However, we argue that this perspective is unable to fully explain the conflicting results found in the literature. To fill this theoretical gap, we devised a model to describe and compare the various levels of realism found in visualizations. We define realism as a combination of three dimensions: geometry, shading, and rendering. By varying these dimensions, it is possible to create a variety of realistic graphics. Thus, when comparing different visualizations, the realism of each of these three dimensions needs to be considered individually. Based on this technical definition, we introduce a cognitive model of learning with realistic visualizations that includes three different stages: perception, schema construction, and testing. At these three stages, variables such as the perceptual load generated by the visualization, learner characteristics influencing how well details are processed, and test types that demand concrete or flexible representations can affect whether realism fosters or hinders learning. Using the cognitive model presented in this paper, more accurate predictions and recommendations concerning the use of realism can be formulated.

AB  - This paper contributes to the ongoing discussion and research on the role of 3D virtual learning environments in teaching and learning. It specifically focuses on the use of video games as an enabling technology in construction higher education. As such, it investigates whether task complexity has any influence on an individual's preferred learning style while learning through virtual reality (VR) technology. To answer this question and address relevant issues, an educational experiment has been designed and conducted. An experimental virtual learning environment, the Situation Engine, was set up as a virtual construction site for undergraduate construction students to experience construction work in progress. The design and development of the Situation Engine has drawn on powerful pedagogical theories such as situated and experiential learning. 253 undergraduate students participated in the educational experiment. Three tasks of different complexity levels were designed as the experimental environments; with level of complexity being the independent variable. The hypothesis that students would adopt different learning styles when engaged in learning tasks of different complexities was rejected. No significant difference in the preferred learning styles was identified among the three experimental groups. It was concluded, therefore, that when using virtual reality technology for construction education there is no evidence to suggest the level of task complexity has significant influence on how people learn. The study presented in this paper is the first empirical study in the construction higher education field that reveals the relationship between the task complexity and students learning styles when Virtual Learning Environments are engaged.

AB  - Learning functional neuroanatomy requires forming mental representations of 3D structure, but forming such representations from 2D textbook diagrams can be challenging. We address this challenge in the UW Virtual Brain Project by developing 3D narrated diagrams, which are interactive, guided tours through 3D models of perceptual systems. Lessons can be experienced in virtual reality (VR) or on a personal computer monitor (PC). We predicted participants would learn from lessons presented on both VR and PC devices (comparing pretest/posttest scores) but that VR would be more effective for achieving both content-based learning outcomes (i.e., test performance) and experience-based learning outcomes (i.e., reported enjoyment and ease of use). All participants received lessons about the visual system and auditory system, one in VR and one on a PC (order counterbalanced). We assessed content learning using a drawing/labeling task on paper (2D drawing) in Experiment 1 and a Looking Glass autostereoscopic display (3D drawing) in Experiment 2. In both experiments, we found that the UW Virtual Brain Project lessons were effective for teaching functional neuroanatomy, with no difference between devices. However, participants reported VR was more enjoyable and easier to use. We also evaluated the VR lessons in our classroom implementation during an undergraduate course on perception. Students reported that the VR lessons helped them make progress on course learning outcomes, especially for learning system pathways. They suggested lessons could be improved by adding more examples and providing more time to

AB  - Neuroanatomy as a subject is important to learn, because a good understanding of neuroanatomy supports the establishment of a correct diagnosis in neurological patients. However, rapid changes in curricula reduced time assigned to study (neuro)anatomy. Therefore, it is important to find alternative teaching methods to study the complex three-dimensional structure of the brain. The aim of this manuscript was to explore the effectiveness of Virtual Reality (VR) in comparison with Radiological Data (RaD) as suitable learning methods to build knowledge and increase motivation for learning neuroanatomy. Forty-seven students (mean age of 19.47 +/- 0.54 years; 43 females; 4 males) were included; 23 students comprised the VR group. Both methods showed to improve knowledge significantly, the improvement between groups was not different. The RaD group showed to have a significantly higher score on expectancy than students in the VR group. Task value scores regarding finding a task interesting, useful and fun were found to be significantly different in favor of the VR group. Consequently, significant higher Motivation scores were found in the VR group. Motivation and expectancy, however, did not moderate learning results, whereas task value impacted the results in favour of the VR group. This study concludes that VR and RaD are effective and diverting methods to learn neuroanatomy, with VR being more motivating than RaD. Future research should investigate motivation and task value when using VR over a longer period of time.

AB  - Over the past two decades, there has been increased interest in understanding the prospects of virtual reality laboratories (VR Labs) in science education. VR Labs are designed to emulate a physical teaching laboratory through an immersive computer experience that affords intimate and intuitive interaction. According to a recent literature review, there is a scantiness of varied theoretical and methodological approaches concerning the student learning experience with VR Labs. Most of the studies were evaluative, seeking to establish the efficacy of VR Labs for meeting specific needs under the expectation that the mere use of them would bring about predetermined student outcomes. A phenomenographic investigation, which assumes that a person's perception is informed by their broader environment and results in multiple perspectives of the same phenomena was employed to investigate the various ways undergraduate chemistry students' experience learning with VR Labs. The inquiry is situated in an undergraduate chemistry course, where the VR Labs aligned with the course curriculum. From a purposive sample of six diverse participants, four qualitatively different experiences were discovered, which included: a) VR Labs hindered my ability to learn b) the amount of content knowledge I have and/or my prior experience influenced my learning c) the affordances I perceived enhanced my learning and d) VR Labs removed barriers I perceived to learning. The more comprehensive understanding provided by this study informs the design and development of new pedagogical approaches and innovative forms of curriculum.

AB  - Featured Application A stereoscopic display without a head-mounted display is highly useful and promising for anatomy education. Several efforts have been made to use virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) for medical and dental education and surgical support. The current methods still require users to wear devices such as a head-mounted display (HMD) and smart glasses, which pose challenges in hygiene management and long-term use. Additionally, it is necessary to measure the user's inter-pupillary distance and to reflect it in the device settings each time to accurately display 3D images. This setting is difficult for daily use. We developed and implemented a novel anatomy education method using a spatial reality display capable of stereoscopic viewing with the naked eye without an HMD or smart glasses. In this study, we developed two new applications: (1) a head and neck anatomy education application, which can display 3D-CG models of the skeleton and blood vessels of the head and neck region using 3D human body data available free of charge from public research institutes, and (2) a DICOM image autostereoscopic viewer, which can automatically convert 2D CT/MRI/CBCT image data into 3D-CG models. In total, 104 students at the School of Dentistry experienced and evaluated the system, and the results suggest its usefulness. A stereoscopic display without a head-mounted display is highly useful and promising for anatomy education.

AB  - There are concerns from higher education (HE) institutions and industry about the decline in standards of technical drawings (TDs) due to the lack of understanding of basic geometric construction and the conventions of drafting skills that underpin the best practices. There is growing evidence that simulations/animations along with augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) technologies can improve learners' engagement, competence, and skills: especially when compared to traditional didactic methods. However, this approach to teaching and learning (T&L) is difficult when studied at distance, or without access to the appropriate technologies to carry out the suggested activities. Leading to the need to develop appropriate methods and content that suit this pedagogical problem.
   This paper describes the development of an AR/VR application to support the T&L of design and engineering students in education and industry. Using a multi-disciplinary design-based research methodology, this European (UK, Bulgaria, Turkey) funded research project combines pedagogy and technology to approach TDs education problems; and to develop an AR/VR education solution to address learning difficulties within the different critical TDs categories identified.
   This development is based on findings from an international study in three different categories covering the perception of TDs education, assessing of TDs knowledge and ability, and expectations of TDs education. This research project also covers the difficulties and good practices of multi-disciplinary teams for developing TDs and ARNR contents where the approaches to T&L may differ between practices.

AB  - The successful employment of Virtual Reality Environments in distance education contexts led to the development of various frameworks and taxonomies related to the Virtual-Learning approach. However, when it comes to Blended or 'Hybrid' Virtual Learning (HVL) scenarios, where the learners are concurrently co-present both in the physical and in the virtual environment, the lines are hard to be drawn as this has been a relatively unexplored area. Considering the aforementioned change in the setup of the educational context, different implications, challenges and outcomes are expected to be observed. Motivated by this shortcoming, we conducted a series of experiments with Computer Science and Technology students and investigated the impact of interactions on learners' motivation to engage with the 3D virtual world and the educational activities by extension. In this paper, We discuss students' preconceptions towards the inclusion of 3D Virtual Learning Environments in the context of their studies and further elicit their thoughts related to the impact of the 'hybrid' interactions. In addition, we investigate the educational value of different Non-Player Characters (Pedagogical Agents) and their impact on the attractiveness of the virtual world and the educational tasks. The concluding remarks provide guidance to educators and instructional designers who work in such setups or consider to employ Pedagogical Agents. To this end, employing Pedagogical Agents requires careful consideration as they need to be meaningful and fully incorporated in the learner's task. Another take-away message concerns the elements that foster a situated learning experience as they are associated with immersive experiences.

AB  - Understanding the principles of computational thinking (CT), e.g., problem abstraction, decomposition, and recursion, is vital for computer science (CS) students. Unfortunately, these concepts can be difficult for novice students to understand. One way students can develop CT skills is to involve them in the design of an application to teach CT. This study focuses on co-designing mini games to support teaching and learning CT principles and concepts in an online environment. Online co-design (OCD) of mini games enhances students' understanding of problem-solving through a rigorous process of designing contextual educational games to aid their own learning. Given the current COVID-19 pandemic, where face-to-face co-designing between researchers and stakeholders could be difficult, OCD is a suitable option. CS students in a Nigerian higher education institution were recruited to co-design mini games with researchers. Mixed research methods comprising qualitative and quantitative strategies were employed in this study. Findings show that the participants gained relevant knowledge, for example, how to (i) create game scenarios and game elements related to CT, (ii) connect contextual storyline to mini games, (iii) collaborate in a group to create contextual low-fidelity mini game prototypes, and (iv) peer review each other's mini game concepts. In addition, students were motivated toward designing educational mini games in their future studies. This study also demonstrates how to conduct OCD with students, presents lesson learned, and provides recommendations based on the authors' experience.

AB  - In recent years, immersive technology tools have burgeoned. After the release of the affordable Oculus Go headset and the Merge Cube, there has been increasing use of virtual, augmented, and extended reality (VR, AR, XR) in classrooms. Of significance to chemistry educators are the virtual lab simulations developed by Labster and HoloLab Champions and the VR app Nanome, which can be used to virtually manipulate chemicals and proteins. So far, however, there are no commercially developed products that address the transfer of chemicals and contaminants during experiments or procedures that require gloves. Herein, we discuss how VR can be used as an active learning approach to lab safety about correct glove hygiene. The work is the result of a collaboration among chemistry, computer science, and library faculty on a VR instructional module on glove hygiene. This experience is useful to bring a realistic and interactive laboratory experience to students who may have limited experience in a laboratory setting. Additionally, the project explores how to optimally use the academic library space to deploy the VR module to a large number of student users. Despite shortcomings we encountered in the first phase of development, we believe that, with technological improvements, there is significant potential for a virtual reality instructional environment that teaches glove hygiene when there may be limited access to physical laboratories.

AB  - In university computer course, character encoding and its processing involves multiple hardware, and the process is relatively complex and mostly invisible, which makes it difficult for students to understand. In this paper, a virtual experiment is proposed to this process. By using Blockly and other tools, students can independently design character encoding and write Blockly code to describe the whole process of character processing. Relying on virtual reality and human-computer interaction technology, the whole process of character processing can be visually demonstrated. It enables students to deeply understand the functions of various character encodings and deepens the understanding of binary coding methods.

AB  - Tecnologico de MonterreylaunchedMostla, an experiential learning space devoted to exploring and working with theemerging technologiesthat have the greatest potential to create better educational practices or reinvent education through novel ways of learning and teaching. In this article, we describe strategic projects in various disciplines and at different cognitive levels. These include those that arise from the experiments performed by faculty and students and those that are deployed at the institutional level. Virtual reality zones, collaborative virtual reality, I 360 degrees courses,Blockchainfor digital credentials, and digital tutors are among the institutional projects described in this work with which Mostla has been involved. Also, several educational projects developed by students and professors are described in detail. We include a review of the implementation processes ofemerging technologiesto provide a perspective on the practices that can help integrate technology into an educational context. The University of Technology, South Africa, theTechnology-Enabled Learning Implementation Handbook,and Queensland Secondary School are among the organizations and resources consulted. TheMostlaimplementation process is also explained in detail. Its four-stage process includes knowing about the technology, experimenting with it, imagining new possibilities, and creating solutions. The implementation of technology in the education arena can be challenging. It is important to be aware of what others have done successfully to adopt advances that improve the teaching-learning process. Commitment at all the university levels, as well as the planning and incorporation strategies, the right infrastructure to support the implementations, the training in the technology provided to the community of users, and the development of engaging activities, are among the best practices encountered in the literature review which we report in this work.

AB  - Objective To investigate the effectiveness of a virtual reality (VR), three-dimensional (3D) clinically orientated temporal bone anatomy module, including an assessment of different display technologies.
   Methods A clinically orientated, procedural and interactive anatomy module was generated from a micro-CT of a cadaveric temporal bone. The module was given in three different display technologies; 2D, 3D with monoscopic vision, and 3D with stereoscopic vision. A randomised control trial assessed the knowledge acquisition and attitudes of 47 medical students though a pretutorial and post-tutorial questionnaire. The questionnaire included questions identifying anatomic structures as well as understanding structural relations and clinical relevance. Furthermore, a five-point Likert scale assessed the students' attitudes to the module and alternative learning outcomes, such as interest in otology and preparedness for clinical rotations.
   Results As a whole cohort, the total test score improved significantly, with a large effect size (p <= 0.005, Cohen's d=1.41). The 23 students who returned the retention questionnaire had a significant improvement in total test score compared with their pretutorial score, with a large effect size (p <= 0.005, Cohen's d=0.83). Display technology did not influence the majority of learning outcomes, with the exception of 3D technologies, showing a significantly improvement in understanding of clinical relevance and structural relations (p=0.034). Students preferred 3D technologies for ease of use, perceived effectiveness and willingness to use again.
   Conclusions The developed VR temporal bone anatomy tutor was an effective self-directed education tool. 3D technology remains valuable in facilitating spatial learning and superior user satisfaction.

AB  - One in every six persons in the UK suffers a hearing loss, either as a condition they have been born with, or they developed during their life. Nine hundred thousand people in the UK are severely or profoundly deaf. Based on a study by Action on Hearing Loss UK in 2013 only 17 percent of this population, can use the British Sign Language (BSL). That leaves a massive proportion of people with a hearing impediment who do not use sign language struggling in social interaction and suffering from emotional distress. It also leaves even a larger proportion of Hearing people who cannot communicate with those of the deaf community. This paper presents a Serious Game (SG) that aims to close the communication gap between able hearing people and people with hearing impairment by providing a tool that facilitates BSL learning targeting the adult population. The paper presents the theoretical framework supporting adult learning based on which a SG game using Virtual Reality (VR) technology has been developed. The paper explains the experimental framework of the study. It presents the creation of the research instruments to facilitate the study comprising of a SG that integrates video and conventional video-based educational material. It reports and analyses the study results that demonstrate the advantage of the SG in effectively supporting users learning a set of BSL signs. It also presents qualitative outcomes that inform the further development of the game to serve learning needs. The paper closes with conclusions, directions for further development of this educational resource, and future studies.

TI  - Impact of virtual reality anatomy training on ultrasound competency development: A randomized controlled trial
T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
KW  - EDUCATION
AB  - Purpose
   The use of Virtual Reality (VR) in health professions education has increased dramatically in recent years, yet there is limited evidence of its impact on educational outcomes. The purpose of the study was to assess the impact of VR anatomy instruction on the ultrasound competency of novice learners participating in a ultrasonography workshop.
   Method
   We designed a VR-enhanced ultrasonography training program and utilized a plane transection tool to interact with a three-dimensional (3D) VR model of the human body which facilitated the 3D conceptualization of the spatial relationship of anatomical structures, leading to faster and better development of ultrasonographic competency. This was a randomized control study which enrolled third-year medical students (n = 101) without previous exposure to formal or informal ultrasonography training. The participants were randomly divided into an intervention and control group. We assessed participants' competency through ultrasound performance stations on live subjects, we also measured anatomical and ultrasound image identification ability using multiple choice tests.
   Result
   Participants in the intervention group (median = 16; interquartile 13 to 19) had significantly higher scores in ultrasonography task performance tests than the control group (median = 10; interquartile 7 to 14; Mann-Whitney U = 595; P < 0.01). In sub-group analysis, the intervention group performed significantly better in the six out of ten ultrasound tasks. Participants in the intervention group also had greater improvement in ultrasonographic image identification MCQ tests than the control group (Mann-Whitney U = 914; P < 0.05).
   Conclusion
   This study suggests that VR-enhanced anatomical training could be of significant benefit in ultrasonography training by promoting a better understanding of the spatial relationships of anatomical structures and the development of early psychomotor skills transferable to the handling of ultrasonographic probes.

AB  - Virtual learning resources (VLRs) developed using immersive technologies like virtual reality are becoming popular in medical education, particularly in anatomy. However, if VLRs are going to be more widely adopted, it is important that they are designed appropriately. The overarching aim of this study was to propose guidelines for the instructional design of VLRs for anatomy education. More specifically, the study grounded these guidelines within cognitive learning theories through an investigation of the cognitive load imposed by VLRs. This included a comparison of stereoscopic and desktop VLR deliveries and an evaluation of the impact of prior knowledge and university experience. Participants were voluntarily recruited to experience stereoscopic and desktop deliveries of a skull anatomy VLR (UNSW Sydney Ethics #HC16592). A MyndBand (R) electroencephalography (EEG) headset was used to collect brainwave data and theta power was used as an objective cognitive load measure. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration task load index (NASA-TLX) was used to collect perceptions as a subjective measure. Both objective and subjective cognitive load measures were higher overall for the stereoscopic delivery and for participants with prior knowledge, and significantly higher for junior students (P = 0.038). Based on this study's results, those of several of our previous studies and the literature, various factors are important to consider in VLR design. These include delivery modality, their application to collaborative learning, physical fidelity, prior knowledge and prior university experience. Overall, the guidelines proposed based on these factors suggest that VLR design should be learner-centred and aim to reduce extraneous cognitive load.

AB  - The novelty of three-dimensional visualization technology (3DVT), such as virtual reality (VR), has captured the interest of many educational institutions. This study's objectives were to (1) assess how VR and physical models impact anatomy learning, (2) determine the effect of visuospatial ability on anatomy learning from VR and physical models, and (3) evaluate the impact of a VR familiarization phase on learning. This within-subjects, crossover study recruited 78 undergraduate students who studied anatomical structures at both physical and VR models and were tested on their knowledge immediately and 48 hours after learning. There were no significant differences in test scores between the two modalities on both testing days. After grouping participants on visuospatial ability, low visuospatial ability learners performed significantly worse on anatomy knowledge tests compared to their high visuospatial ability counterparts when learning from VR immediately (P = 0.001, d = 1.515) and over the long-term (P = 0.003, d = 1.279). In contrast, both low and high visuospatial ability groups performed similarly well when learning from the physical model and tested immediately after learning (P = 0.067) and over the long-term (P = 0.107). These results differ from current literature which indicates that learners with low visuospatial ability are aided by 3DVT. Familiarizing participants with VR before the learning phase had no impact on learning (P = 0.967). This study demonstrated that VR may be detrimental to low visuospatial ability students, whereas physical models may allow all students, regardless of their visuospatial abilities, to learn similarly well.

AB  - Virtual and haptic technologies are virtual reality solutions used in many areas of life. The potential of VR solutions is still growing due to, among others: introducing new hardware, software updates, building VR applications using open source tools. The use of VR in education and training should be aimed at achieving the right level of immersion and interaction, providing a large number of signals replacing sensory impressions (touch, sight, hearing) from the real world. Of course, it is important to convey substantive content in a comfortable and easy way. Educating or training people using VR causes them to be involved in solving complex problems, experiencing the physical properties of virtual objects. Many research centers and companies are working on interactive training tools. It is important to maintain the reality of virtual situations, the safety of educated/trained persons and the correct operation of the VR system (calibration, configuration).
   Bearing in mind the possibilities of VR systems in teaching and the costs of VR equipment, the author decided to: compare professional VR systems with low-cost systems, propose a low-cost VR station for learning / training at home, examine the level of immersion of individual VR system solutions and the degree of effectiveness of virtual learning/training groups of respondents.
   As a result of the analysis, it is found that a high level of immersion and the quality of the virtual environment affect greater efficiency of learning/training. Low-cost VR systems have limitations that create an ideal environment for virtual learning/training, but for home use they are sufficient. There are many benefits of using VR in learning and training, including: unlimited learning time, access to virtual subjects, workstations, process simulations.

AB  - Individuals' coding skills have been highlighted in education systems. However, there has been a gap related to inspiring educators and students to enhancing their coding skills based on textual syntax practices [1], [2], in particular, through building three dimensional (3D) and virtual reality (VR) based environments in combination with applying k-12 curriculum sciences concepts [3], [4], [5]. The goal of this work is analyzing a case of inspiring individuals direct manipulating Web3D based advanced production and information visualization technology (APIVT) for learning how to coding and applying sciences concepts of a given curriculum at k-12 levels. The strategy for carrying out this experimental work of continuing flux has been inspiring ones' coding literacy skills through a before/after school educational project [3], [4], [6], [7]. This inspiration has occurred with support of computational action [8] and immersive education [9] concepts via utilizing web browser based platforms for coding and visualizing digital content [5], [9], [11], [13], [14], [15]. It has included using computer graphics techniques for storytelling and simulating in VR [4], [10], [11], stimulating reading and writing abilities [1], [2], [12], solving problems and developing symbolic representations [13], [14], [15], [16], [17]. As results, this work has implicated in inspiring individuals' meaningful APIVT appropriation and ubiquitous learning based on computational action in practice. It also has brought about affecting subjects' collaborative lifelong learning and professional development attitudes related to enhancing their storytelling, scientific, cognitive, spatial, visual and digital skills through using a combination of VR and coding techniques throughout designing and building 3D digital environments in association with connecting and enhancing scientific and digital transdisciplinary knowledge at k-12 levels.

AB  - BackgroundAssessment of the middle ear requires a complex three-dimensional understanding, the teaching of which is just as important for curricular teaching as for further medical training.ObjectiveThe extent to which virtual reality (VR) can be used as an alternative to conventional educational methods for teaching anatomy, physiology, and pathology was examined. The objective was to evaluate a VR-supported teaching method in comparison to conventional learning on an anatomic model.MethodsThe study was conducted as a prospective two-arm single-center trial in the summer semester of 2021 at the University Hospital of Freiburg. During a seminar on the topic of the middle ear, 177 students were randomly assigned to either a control or a study group. Demographic data were collected in advance and a quantitative evaluation regarding competence and personal attitude was performed. After processing the models, the groups were formatively tested and the results were analyzed comparatively. Ultimately, crossover of the models enabled a qualitative comparative evaluation of the models and a renewed quantitative evaluation was carried out.ResultsNo significant differences between the groups were identified in the formative testing. The evaluations demonstrated increased self-assessment of knowledge competence, a tendency towards a highly positive attitude towards the VR method after completion of the course, and generally beneficial subjective aspects of the VR model. In addition, there was a positive effect and a positive perception of the delivery of anatomic content.ConclusionUse of VR is suitable as an alternative to conventional teaching methods in curricular ENT teaching. The current evidence demonstrates the equality of VR and indicates its great potential for future educational tasks.

AB  - Elementary, middle, and high school students need opportunities to engage with educational technology. This is particularly essential for those students who may not have access to new technologies at home and/or school. The socioeconomic status continues to increase the digital divide and equity in education in terms of access to technology; and as new and advanced technology becomes more available for some, others are falling further behind. A key component in ensuring all K-12 students receive opportunities to engage with technology is to prepare preservice teachers to be proficient at using new educational technologies in their classrooms. Virtual Reality (VR) environments are gaining traction across some environments. However, in the United States, some states limit or exclude VR from elementary and middle grades. In a recent service-learning project, 14 preservice teachers were introduced to two types of floor-robots and one style of a VR headset. Most preservice teachers had not used any of the technology prior to the required course. After learning how to manipulate floor-robots and navigate virtual environments, they taught middle and high school students with exceptionalities how to use technology to enhance comprehension of mathematics and social studies content. Of the 14 preservice teachers in the course, seven agreed to allow their surveys and reflections to be used for data collection and analysis. Results demonstrate that preservice teachers view technology for use in school settings favorably, and they believed that middle and high school students with exceptionalities benefitted from the educational technology instructional experiences. However, there were some concerns about costs.

AB  - This paper studies the effect of laboratory activities on the results obtained by the students on 7 core curricular units (CUs) of an Integrated Master in Mechanical Engineering. Each CU is characterized by means of 4 performance indices, over the 6-year period 2014/2015-2019/2020. Firstly, individual indices in a per semester basis are compared. Secondly, the CUs are regarded as objects defined in a 4-dimensional space of features, and the multidimensional scaling (MDS) technique is adopted for clustering and computer visualization. The MDS is powerful for analyzing the multivariate dataset, unveiling patterns not perceived by standard statistical methods.

TI  - Ultrasound Biomicroscopy Diagnosis Analysis and Fine Care of Anterior Segment Injury of Traumatic Anterior Chamber Based on Intelligent Virtual Reality Technology
T2  - JOURNAL OF HEALTHCARE ENGINEERING
LA  - English
KW  - ANXIETY
AB  - The front part of the eye is exposed to the surface of the body, making it susceptible to injury. Blunt eye injuries often destroy the tissue structure in the anterior part of the eye. Often there is detachment of the iris root, separation of the ciliary body, the angle of retraction of the chamber, and complete dislocation or subluxation of the lens. Ordinary ocular ultrasound can penetrate into opaque tissue, but because of its low resolution, it can only show its outline, which is still very small for doctors in assisting diagnosis. Ultrasonic biomicroscopy is a very real-time analysis, will not be affected by the refraction space, and has great application value for ocular trauma. Based on this, this article proposes the ultrasound biomicroscope diagnosis analysis and fine nursing research of traumatic anterior chamber injury based on intelligent virtual reality technology. This article describes literature methods, experimental analysis methods, and other methods, in-depth study of the causes of traumatic anterior injuries, ultrasound biomicroscopy, and other theoretical knowledge, ultrasound biomicroscopy and microcontrol experiments for traumatic anterior injury design, and finally the causes of eye damage. This study compares the pairing results of ultrasound biomicroscopy biological measurements, analyzes the relationship between anterior bleeding level and anterior ocular injury, and analyzes the outcome and extent of service ophthalmology. The angle retreat accounted for 52.17% in grade I, 72.22% in grade II, and 60% in grade III. Anterior bleeding can cause single or complex iris root detachment, iris root detachment, ciliary body detachment, and angular leakage. The more the bleeding, the more serious the eye damage.

AB  - Understanding three-dimensional cardiac anatomy is fundamental for the practice of clinical cardiology. However, if three-dimensional images are displayed on two-dimensional monitors, they fail to provide depth perception. Currently, novel technologies, including the three-dimensional printing, three-dimensional monitors/projectors, and virtual reality applications can provide real three-dimensionality with depth perception. However, their relatively high cost and limited user-friendliness prevent their wide application. We introduce novel and commercially available holographic display, which allows multiple observers to see the full-color holographic images simultaneously without any specific glasses and headgear. This leading-edge technology is immediately applicable in both educational and clinical settings.

KW  - VIRTUAL FIELD TRIP
AB  - 360-degree models are a variant of virtual reality and are software-generated from multiple images of a space taken by 360-degree cameras. 360-degree models allow viewers virtually walking through them by jumping to the various viewpoints of the model. In addition, 360-degree models may be augmented with further media, such as text, graphics, or videos. Augmented as such, 360-degree models seem to be promising learning tools as their design incorporates multiple principles of multimedia learning, such as the contiguity principle, as well as 360-degree models support various approaches of learning, such as explorative learning. Evaluating the notion of 360-degree model as learning tools, this paper presents an exploratory study of the 360-degree model of an innovative wastewater treatment system named P-Bank. Methodologically, participants (N=17) were asked to explore the P-Bank 360-degree model for acquiring knowledge, which thereafter was assessed in a post-test. After the post-test, a questionnaire surveyed the participants' motivation and emotion on the one hand, and the usability of the model on the other hand. In addition, further aspects were determined qualitatively based on guided interviews conducted with each participant. In summary, the results are consistently promising: the usability of the 360-degree model was rated as good, motivation and emotion received excellent values and the learning outcomes were positive. The results of the interviews conducted provided information valid for further development of the 360-degree model. Overall, the study contributes to establishing 360-degee models as effective learning tools in environmental engineering education.

AB  - English has been recognized as a means of communication around the globe. However, owing to the lack of realistic English practicing contexts, EFL (English as Foreign Language) students generally have few opportunities to communicate with people in English, not to mention to get feedback from others for making reflections. In this study, a spherical video-based virtual reality (SVVR) environment was developed to situate students in authentic English-speaking contexts; moreover, the peer assessment (PA) strategy was employed for guiding students to provide comments on peers' speaking performance and to make reflections on their own performance. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, an experiment was conducted in a high school English course. The experiment results reveal more positive effects of the peer-assessment-based SVVR approach compared with the non-peer-assessment-based SVVR approach in terms of the learners' English speaking, learning motivation, and critical thinking skills, as well as reducing their English learning anxiety. Moreover, it was found that the ratings of the students were statistically correlated with those of the teacher. This study further analyzed the types of peer comments by categorizing them into four types: Praise, Criticism, Opinion, and Irrelevant. It was found that Praise feedback was helpful for the students' English-speaking performance, while Criticism feedback might have been unfavorable in this case. Additionally, Irrelevant feedback was not significantly correlated with the students' performance in the earlier PA stage, but had a significantly negative correlation in the later stage.

AB  - A haptic interface having three degrees of freedom of type arm RRR (three rotation joint type) has been designed. This was connected to a virtual environment composed of a robot-like arm of type RRR and a virtual research laboratory. Any action on the haptic interface will generate an animation of the virtual robot according to haptic joint values. The utility of this platform will allow the student studying the robotic movements to simulate many robotic tasks. A geometrical model of the robot and the joint constraints were integrated in the virtual environment. The simulator developed in the study can be adapted to any RRR type robot by modifying only the Denavit Hartenberg parameters and the joint constraint values.

AB  - Visual programming environments such as Scratch have been proposed for beginners. In those environments, programming is possible by arranging function blocks expressed on two dimensions. In order to improve the browsability of many blocks, an environment for programming by arranging functional blocks with hand gesture interaction in immersive VR space has been proposed. However, the usability of the environment was low due to the error of estimation of hand gesture. Therefore, in this study, we propose an operation method using VR controller for programming in an immersive VR environment and confirm the usability of the method by comparing with a method by hand gesture. We will incorporate these results into future development.

AB  - Upgrading the workers' skills through adequate training is highly demanded in modern companies seeking for overall productivity and competitiveness. Currently the spread of technology-based training has fostered the development of new training approaches appositely designed for workers. In this paper, we introduce a new training platform that uses a virtual learning environment that combines virtual reality (VR) and 360 degree technologies. In particular, we focus on the problem of predicting the outcome of the workers' training based on how the workers have behaved in the virtual learning environment during their training session. To this aim, we formulate a process mining methodology that combines features engineering and classification algorithms. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology has been validated against a real use case.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this study was to investigate 3D virtual reality (VR) situated activity, preschool reality and how the lecture teaching method affects technology university students' learning outcome. Design/methodology/approach The quasi-experimental design is used. Participants are 144 students in three classes who all take Child Development Assessment course. Research instruments include 3D VR animation, preschool live video and child development as the case. One class attended 3D VR situated activities, another observed preschool live video and the other takes a traditional lecture class. Learning outcomes were measured by two paper-and-pencil tests in different times and with one performance assessment. In the writing test, mechanical and meaningful questions were included. Findings Major findings of this study are, first, that the auxiliary learning of 3D VR is better than the real-life situation. Second, situational learning activities can enhance participant performance in context-based questions. In summary, this study found that well-organized 3D VR animation is more effective than live situation learning, especially for context-based course content. Research limitations/implications The lack of random assignment into test groups leads to non-equivalent test groups which can limit the generalizability of the results to other student population. Practical implications The findings of this study suggest that teachers can gradually arrange learning activities, from 3D VR to a real applied workplace; situated learning activities are more likely to support the transfer knowledge to real-life problem solving. Originality/value The findings suggest that teachers in arranging the classroom context activities can be the first to use 3D VR before actual reality to avoid novices getting lost in the complicated real situations. If learning activities can be arranged gradually, from 3D VR to real applied workplace, situated learning activities can help students to deploy their newly acquired knowledge and skills in real-life problem solving.

AB  - Mobile technology - such as tablets, cell phones, and wearable devices - has the potential to play a useful role in promoting academic learning. This potential motivates this special issue on "Mobile Technology, Learning, and Achievement: Advances in Understanding and Measuring the Role of Mobile Technology in Education" edited by Matthew L. Bernacki, Jeffrey Greene, and Helen Crompton. Research on learning with mobile technology should focus on three research questions: Do students learn academic content better with mobile technology than with conventional media (media comparison question)? Which instructional features afforded by mobile technology cause learning (instructional method question)? Under what conditions do students learn academic content better with mobile technology than with conventional media (boundary condition question)? A research agenda is proposed.

AB  - The recent COVID-19 restrictions have forced many museums and entertainment institutions to shut their doors to visitors. This initiated an extraordinary impact on the heritage sector, forcing museum professionals to rethink and reshape how heritage contents could be made more accessible. This paper is part of ongoing research for developing a theoretical framework towards enhancing the visitor experience within the museum environments. The study investigates the implementation of gamified storytelling experience within the context of immersive technology in museum environments towards increasing the level of immersion of the visitor's when "interacting" with museum artefacts. Digital technology allows museum professionals to implement advanced interaction within their exhibition displays, enabling visitors to be more active and involved in the knowledge exchange process. Museum display and exhibition practices are beginning to explore the potential of immersive technology to provide visitors with meaningful experiences that facilitate the transfer of knowledge. In this study, Virtual Reality (VR) is considered as an instrument that could enable better interpretation of these artefacts. To add and increase immersion and meaningful interactions in VR experiences, this study investigates storytelling and gamified approaches as key enablers of such experiences. The study covers engineering heritage with the Lanchester petrol-electric car developed in 1927 as the subject matter and also an artefact. The car, the inventor, Frederick Lanchester, and the history serves as the focal point of the investigation into the gamified immersive representations of museum objects. Three different VR experiments (gamified, narrated, and immersive) will be conducted in closed (university lab) and open (museum) environments to validate and determine the framework's impact on enhancing the users' experiences and interpretations. The developed framework will benefit museums exhibition in general by improving the interpretation process and educational experience for the visitors. The paper describes different approaches considered in this study such as gamification and storytelling practices in museum mediums to improve immersions and motivation of the visitors.

AB  - After the World Health Organization had declared a pandemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on March 11, 2020 many governments, including the Government of Spain, declared the state of alarm enforcing a quarantine that have left millions of students confined to their homes. This home confinement has affected students of all levels, including university students, and has forced faculties to adapt online teaching strategies. Thus, traditional classroom face-to-face teaching has suddenly been replaced by online classes. This has revealed particularly challenging for medical courses. For such purpose we have designed an online teaching proposal addressed to the Degree in Physiotherapy and the Double Degree in Nursing and Physiotherapy of the University of Jaen (Spain). The objective is to implement an online virtual teaching protocol through the use of Virtual Reality. For such a goal, the Leap Motion Controller (LMC) will be used to teach the neuroanatomy of the brain and spinal cord and to teach and practice neurorehabilitation exercises. Along with devices like the LMC students will be asked to use Health Sciences databases in order to achieve a significative learning of the course topics. The project is structured in two phases. First, students will learn neuroanatomy and neurophysiology of the most relevant neurological conditions using LMC-based models. Then, they will learn to combine LMC games and conventional physiotherapy for neurorehabilitation purposes. The work of students will include the recording of videoreports demonstrating the acquisition of neuroanatomy concepts and simulating a clinical case. With this project we will assess the usability of LMC as an educative tool, the perception, satisfaction and self-regulated learning of physiotherapy students.

AB  - The lostness measure, an implicit and unobtrusive measure originally designed for assessing the usability of hypertext systems, could be useful in Virtual Reality (VR) games where players need to find information to complete a task. VR locomotion systems with node-based movement mimic actions for exploration and browsing found in hypertext systems. For that reason, hypertext usability measures, such as "lostness" can be used to identify how disoriented a player is when completing tasks in an educational game by examining steps made by the player. An evaluation of two different lostness measures, global and local lostness, based on two different types of tasks, is described in a VR educational game using 13 college students between 14 and 18 years old in a first study and extended using 12 extra participants in a second study. Multiple Linear Regression analyses showed, in both studies, that local lostness, and not global lostness, had a significant effect on a post-game knowledge test. Therefore, we argued that local lostness was able to predict how well-participants would perform on a post-game knowledge test indicating how well they learned from the game. In-game experience aspects (engagement, cognitive interest, and presence) were also evaluated and, interestingly, it was also found that participants learned less when they felt more present in the game. We believe these two measures relate to cognitive overload, which is known to have an adverse effect on learning. Further research should investigate the lostness measure for use in an online adaptive game system and design the game system in such a way that the risk of cognitive overload is minimized when learning, resulting in higher retention of information.

AB  - This study utilized a VR eye-tracker to analyze visual attention as well as compare the differences in internal behavioral cognition during program debugging assignments. In this study, 40 students were recruited as participants who studied C++ programming language courses for at least one year in the department of computer science. Forty participants (27 men and 13 women) were categorized into field independence (FI) and field dependence (FD) groups based on their Group Embedded-Figures Test (GEFT) scores. Based on defined the regions of interest (ROIs), this studyused eye movement indicators to discussthe difference in visual attention between various ROIs during the program debugging task. The results indicated that different participants' cognitive styles led to different gaze sequences of viewing ROIs; no significant difference was identified in students' visual fixation on viewing the ROIs of programs between the FI and FD groups based on the latency of first fixation (LFF); a partly significant difference was identified in students' visual fixation on viewing the ROIs of programs between the FI and FD groups based on the duration of first fixation (DFF); in the FI group, students showed longer fixation durations and fixation counts than their FD counterparts on viewing the ROIs of programs; different gender have different gaze sequences of viewing ROIs; a partly significant difference was identified in students' visual fixation on viewing the ROIs of programs by gender based on the LFF and DFF; man students showed longer fixation durations than women students in viewing the ROIs of programs based on the total fixation duration (TFD); and based on fixation counts (FC), there were inconsistent comparison results in FC by gender in viewing the ROIs of programs.

AB  - Use of video as a representation of practice in teacher education is commonplace. The current study explored the use of a new format (360 video) in the context of preservice teachers' professional noticing. Findings suggest that preservice teachers viewing 360 videos attended to more student actions than their peers viewing standard video. In addition, using a virtual reality headset to view the 360 videos led to different patterns in where preservice teachers looked in the recorded classroom, and to increased specificity of mathematics content from the scenario. Thus, findings and results support the use of 360 video in teacher education to facilitate teacher noticing. However, future research is needed to further explore this novel technology.

AB  - Equal access to an instructor's time and attention can be a barrier experienced by many underrepresented minorities. An instructor's own biases will determine the nature of their interaction with students, and even well-meaning instructors can interact with students in differential ways, which might prevent certain students from having access to the material in the class. This is an insidious problem, which may or may not be recognized in peer and student evaluations, and an issue that might escape self-reflection even in educators that are committed to diversity and inclusion. This issue conflates both actual and perceived biases, introducing a complex dynamic between instructor and student. Virtual reality (VR) provides an avenue to generate materials that can be used to enhance or replace classroom instruction with a great degree of realism. Our approach at NC State University was to design VR laboratories that were as inclusive and diverse as possible. This encompassed sourcing content and tapping talent from students that represented a broad range of races, gender identities, and ethnicities. These realistic simulations offer the advantage of minimizing instructor bias (since the instructor generates the material in the absence of the students) while offering students that might struggle with the instructor in a personal setting the opportunity to experience the best that the instructor has to offer. Analysis of the data collected in a user study of VR materials created for organic chemistry laboratories offers insights into the way that students interact with VR instructors. Comments provided by underrepresented minority students point to the perceived impartiality of the instructor, ability to engage with the material independently, and remote access as some of the desirable features of the experience.

AB  - Background In-depth understanding of facial anatomy is the foundation of clinical education and practices. Lately, anatomy education has undergone many changes due to the adoption of integrated medical curriculums. The time allocated to anatomy teaching on occasion been shortened to allow more time for clinical education. Innovation in visual technology such as virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR) and mixed reality (MR) has added a new dimension to anatomy education. The authors present a mixed reality virtual face model to facilitate complex anatomy teaching using Microsoft HoloLens in various educational settings.
   Materials and Methods Close-range photogrammetry technique was utilised to construct a virtual face using a dissected fresh-frozen cephalus. Scanning was undertaken using DSLR cameras, capable of capturing ten frames per second, in ten different angles on the dissected side and four for the undissected side. The images of the entire cephalous were also separately captured in twenty different angles. These images were processed using software to reconstruct the three-dimensional virtual face.
   Result The virtual face using a mixed reality platform was able to demonstrate individual layers of the face and relevant clinically significant structures clearly with interactive labelling. Face and the content validity by 12 experts (plastic surgeons and dermatologists) demonstrated strong inter-rater reliability expressed as interclass correlation coefficient.
   Conclusion An immersive experience by using Microsoft HoloLens provides an accurate 3D perception of the face to enhance anatomy learning. This can be utilised in undergraduate, postgraduate and continued medical education as an additional teaching tool in the constraints of cadaveric dissection.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had enormous effects on anatomy education. During the pandemic, students have had no access to cadavers, which has been the principal way to learn anatomy since the 17th century. As it is difficult to predict future access to cadavers for students or in-person classes, anatomy educators are encouraged to revisit all possible teaching methods in order to develop innovations. Here, we review anatomy education methods to apply to current and future education.

AB  - The present technology report is aimed at demonstrating how the implementation of VR chemistry simulations of atomic structure enhances learning among students. MEL Chemistry VR lessons were incorporated into the classroom for 43 first-year undergraduate ITMO University students. The visualization techniques provided the learners with two important opportunities: (1) connecting the macroscopic and tangible component of chemistry with the submicroscopic component (the real world and the world of molecules) and (2) connecting the submicroscopic component of chemistry with the representational one (atomic structure and orbital diagrams). The results show that implementation of the VR experience into the atomic structure laboratory enhances the learning experience of the students.

AB  - By leveraging emerging technologies in augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR), a Virtual Dental Library and AR virtual tooth identification test were developed at a U.S. dental school. The AR virtual tooth identification test is a vision-based AR application that uses three-dimensional models of extracted human teeth as test items. The aims of this study were to investigate the validity of the AR virtual tooth identification test and evaluate the users' experience with the virtual testing method. The AR virtual tooth identification test scores were compared with real tooth identification tests, scores on three quizzes, final exam, and final grade for the course to assess its validity. In addition, a survey was used to assess students' perceptions of the AR tool. In 2018, all 109 first-year dental students who had completed the dental anatomy course were invited to participate in the study. Of the 93 participants, 61 (56% of total students) were included in the correlation analysis (32 were excluded due to incomplete test answer sheets or missing criterion measures). All 93 could respond to the survey and provide comments. In the results, the AR virtual tooth identification test had a positive correlation with the real tooth identification test (r=0.410, p<0.01), a combined score of two real tooth identification tests (r=0.545, p<0.01), the final exam (r=0.489, p<0.01), and overall grade for the dental anatomy course (r=0.661, p<0.01). On the tests, the students had some difficulty in viewing and manipulating the images and experienced technical difficulties related to their smartphones, and their survey responses expressed little support for the AR tool. Nevertheless, this study demonstrated criterion validity of the AR virtual assessment tool for tooth identification.

It has been established that conversion to the model of digital economy is accompanied by new qualitative modifications of social and economic relations both at the governmental level and at the level of business entities. This process is characterized by new capabilities and hazards. It has been revealed that the fraction of internet economy increases in gross domestic product, though, the digital transformation will deal with all sectors of most countries of the world. At the same time, in order to estimate the efficiency of digital economy, it is necessary to have common and unique procedures, which are currently unavailable. Therefore, the development strategy of digital economy cannot be established just to verify the new concept.

During the years that we have been working in LUMA Centre Saimaa (an organization to inspire and motivate children and youth in mathematics, science and technology), we have noticed that upper secondary school students often fail to see the connection between mathematics studied at that level and their future career plans. This work-in-progress paper describes a construction and first user experiences of project TyoMAA, which aims at strengthening the high school students' perceptions of the applicability of mathematics in the working life. This is done by giving upper secondary school mathematics teachers real working life examples connected to topics in their courses and developing a MOOC for students in which they can solve work-related mathematical problems.

Panels of Virtual patients (VPs) are widely being used in health professions education to facilitate the development of clinical reasoning. VPs can also be used to teach wider educational outcomes such as communication skills, resource utilisation and longitudinal patient care. This chapter will define virtual patients and examine the evidence behind their use in health professions learning and teaching. The chapter will discuss virtual patient design, such as gamification. Finally, the chapter will discuss where this pedagogical innovation is best integrated into assessment and potential barriers to implementation into existing curricula.

AB  - Regardless of the country, there is a trend: the world of school and the modern world are two different poles. Young people see school as boring compared to the entertainment of today's technology. Most students prefer to play or surf the internet, but not study. Gamification is projected as a methodological practice that aims to turn classrooms into playful immersion scenarios, using participatory strategies with the incorporation of electronic devices. This article shows the results obtained by applying gamification techniques in the research project aimed at supporting astronomy learning for basic education students. When using the app, the student must overcome challenges to earn different achievements and rewards. Among the results highlights the student's motivation during the learning process and the perception of satisfaction of the personal achievements achieved.

AB  - The role of human-computer interaction in school lessons is usually limited, if at all, to the usability factor of applications. In this paper, we report on a set of teaching principles and a project in which students between the ages of 15 and 18 playfully work through 3D, Virtual Reality, and usability issues without any particular prior knowledge in this field. In this work, we show that the suggested approach is founded on general didactic principles. Furthermore, by following neurodidactic findings, it is highly appealing to students, and essential computing science skills can be taught quasi incidentally. By systematically mapping our setting and decisions to teaching principles, we also show that HCI is not only one topic to be taught - it becomes a valuable didactic tool.

AB  - Preservice teachers (PSTs) often experience professional anxiety when managing their classrooms. These feelings of anxiety can be reduced, and their feelings of self-efficacy increased by training PSTs' interpersonal competence. This study used authentic learning experiences combining theoretical lectures and 360-degree videos watched with virtual reality headsets, to train their interpersonal competence. Participants of this study were 141 first year PSTs of a teacher education institute in the Netherlands. Results showed that the video-lecture combination led to a reduced professional anxiety and increased self-efficacy. PSTs' self-perceptions of their own expected interpersonal behaviour indicated that PSTs thought they would be more in control in the actual classroom after the intervention. PSTs attributed these results to exemplary teacher behaviour shown in the 360-degree videos.

AB  - Remote association requires players to use their mental transformation to identify objects' relationships by activating knowledge application. A Chinese Remote Association game was designed (example question: 6a02;(sic)x8eca;, where the answer isx5feb;) to explore learners' cognitive and affective effects, and then eighth grade students were invited to play using their smartphones. Data were collected for confirmatory factor analysis with structural equation modeling. The results revealed that intrinsic cognitive load was negatively related to flow experience, while gameplay interest was positively related to flow experience, and flow experience was positively related to performance progress in Chinese association. The implication of this study is that using remote Chinese association as an application game can enhance players' flow experience and performance.

AB  - This study investigated the use of a virtual learning environment, TeachLivE, using pre-post group design to examine the effects of repeated virtual rehearsal sessions. Based upon past findings on the effectiveness of four 10-minutes sessions, the research team used refined methods to examine the effects of these sessions on 102 secondary science teachers. Teachers who took part in the simulated activities significantly increased their targeted behaviors compared to colleagues who had not taken part in the simulation activities. These results of behavior changes that occurred in the simulation were found to transfer back to the real classroom settings for the experimental group (simulation use). Results from this study further validates the impact of simulation in teacher education, showing professional learning in virtual-reality simulated classrooms can positively impact targeted teaching practices in a concentrated amount of time.

AB  - Biology and biochemistry students must learn to visualize and comprehend the complex three-dimensional (3D) structures of macromolecules such as proteins or DNA. However, most tools available for teaching biomolecular structures typically operate in two dimensions. Here, we present protocols and pedagogical approaches for using immersive augmented reality (AR) visors, specifically the Microsoft HoloLens, to reinforce learning with large scale 3D holographic structures. We developed a novel workflow to render vividly colored custom biomolecules in AR visors. In addition, we developed AR exercises to review concepts relevant to protein or DNA structure and then implemented the exercises in four different biology and biochemistry courses. Surveys showed that students reported greater interest in biomolecular structures after the exercise. We also highlight some of the advantages and disadvantages of the software and hardware of this upcoming technology.

AB  - Teaching needs to find new ways all the time. This research aims to renew both the contents and the methodology of teaching the geography of Hungary in primary and secondary education by developing a package of new tools (tasksheets, online and ICT-based activities, teacher support material and even VR), which focus on a selection of regions, landscapes and settlements. It is based on the activities of a research group of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences established in 2016, involving both secondary school teachers, university lecturers and teacher trainees. The research is concluded within the methodological framework of problem-based (Barrows, Kelson) and project-based learning (Dewey, Kilpatrick), but also relies heavily on digital devices and Internet-based resources. The purpose of the research group is not only to expand teachers' inventory and skill set but to help modern methods and practices spread across teaching communities while offering students new ways to improve their skills and digital competence within their Geography studies.
   As part of this research, a sample learning environment has been developed to show secondary schools geography teachers how to use the VR environment for designing problem-based methods. The Lake Balaton area, one of Hungary's most visited tourist regions, is used to present the sample environment. We use the MaxWhere collaborative service (3D Web + 3D Cloud + 3D Apps) that provides predesigned and predefined working areas in which users (teachers and students) can manage their own projects with personalized and shared contents by using modern Web technologies in a very natural and creative way. In that particular case, students are encouraged to discover this new digital environment and create their own interactive Balaton projects, which require individual research and are all connected the recent geographical issues and problems raised in the teaching material.
   We believe the introduction of VR to Geography teaching is not only motivating for students and teachers but demonstrates some collaborative techniques that can be applied to knowledge transfer and the development of creative thinking in other subjects as well.

AB  - Serious games are often characterised as being games developed and used for educational or non-entertainment purposes. The academic literature is saturated with definitions and developed games surrounding the concept. Despite this, there is a lack of quality meta-analytical and longitudinal analysis studies associated with use of serious games. One area where serious games have pedagogical potential is in teaching historical subjects and in displaying historical artefacts. Serious games, combined with evolving 3D modelling techniques and Virtual Reality (VR) capabilities can replicate historical events, artefacts, and environments. The creation of a serious game or even virtual museum that informs individuals about the past have the potential to provide a sense of historical realism or immersion. In the context of Covid-19 and the current global impact to the tourist industry, the application of serious games for such purposes has undoubted significance. This paper reviews the academic literature surrounding the concepts of content and assessment integration in relation to developing historical games for pedagogical and knowledge sharing purposes. The research focuses on two points. Firstly, can serious games exhibit a sense of realism and immersion towards teaching and learning history. Secondly, what are the immersive characteristics needed to make a historical game immersive. Based on the literature this paper will provide a framework that identifies best practice towards making historical games immersive from a games design perspective. The paper also presents an example of a serious game intended to educate users about military machinery used in World War two. A display of 3D modelled Roman artefacts is also presented to document how 3D modelling can replicate an interactive and immersive virtual experience. The findings of the paper argue that there is a close interdependency between aesthetical and content design and learning outcomes towards depicting historical realism and immersion. Future empirical work is also discussed in the paper with the aim of evaluating the framework presented.

KW  - experiential learning
AB  - Ohm's Law (V=R*I) is one of the most important rules that any electrical engineer needs to understand. According to vocational instructors who are experienced with learners of heterogeneous educational backgrounds, an overall challenge is to convey a conception of the dependency between voltage, resistance and current. As physical explanations for electricity are complex theoretical constructs, abstraction models and metaphors are used to teach these concepts and their interdependencies. Especially the metaphors do explain certain characteristics but are only applicable to a certain extent. In-class experiments are usually considered to make electrical concepts and components tangible but are limited to simple scenarios that produce observable effects in an (due to regulations) extremely fail-safe environment. In contrast, targeting this topic in a virtual reality (VR) environment could offer several advantages, as the technology facilitates visual representations of abstract content as well as operating in dangerous - yet if simulated harmless - situations. Additionally, proven positive effects of digital game-based learning can be used to optimize learning effects. This paper describes the design-based and iterative development process of a cooperative virtual reality game which aims to improve the understanding of Ohm's Law. Learners cannot only gain insights on power circuits, but they can also perceive the effects of adapting voltage and resistance. Whereas one of the participants plays the game in VR and is teleported to a crashing space station, classmates support the operator by solving calculation tasks and providing relevant information. The gameplay is designed to allow trainees to construct knowledge according to the experiential learning theory as well as to encourage them to collaborate with their teammates in small groups. Furthermore, the paper will discuss the impact of the game which is currently evaluated with students at different vocational training centres. Learning effects are measured by non-participant observation, questionnaires and group interviews before, during and after the experiments. Early findings indicate an improved understanding of Ohm's Law and reveal evidence for a correlation between the target group and the test environment, which will be further investigated.

AB  - Of the many disruptive technologies being introduced within modern curricula, the metaverse, is of particular interest for its ability to transform the environment in which students learn. The modern metaverse refers to a computer-generated world which is networked, immersive, and allows users to interact with others by engaging a number of senses (including eyesight, hearing, kinesthesia, and proprioception). This multisensory involvement allows the learner to feel part of the virtual environment, in a way that somewhat resembles real-world experiences. Socially, it allows learners to interact with others in real-time regardless of where on earth they are located. This article outlines 20 use-cases where the metaverse could be employed within a health sciences, medicine, anatomy, and physiology disciplines, considering the benefits for learning and engagement, as well as the potental risks.

AB  - This study examined behavior patterns from the perspective of student engagement in VR co-creation. This causal-comparative research involved 66 tenth-grade students, including 39 males (59%) and 27 females (41%) at a public senior high school in northern Taiwan. 22 out of 66 were engaged in VR co-creation, where more than 50 hours of video data were chronologically analyzed in 5-second slots based on the Interaction Analysis Model (IAM). A total of 31,592 behavioral codes were visualized in the transition pattern. The study suggests that learners' accumulated co-creation time and experiences may help develop cognitive attributes and preferred learning modality, resulting in significant behavioral and cognitive engagement, whereas the strength of novelty in raising VR co-creators' initial affective responses may decline inevitably.

AB  - Virtual worlds and Web XR technologies offer to both programmers and domain experts nearly unlimited capabilities for creating novel computer-based simulated environments just in a web browser. Virtual time is becoming the new crucial concept of collaborative, immersive virtual learning environments (VLE). This paper explores the Croquet software architecture, which is known for its radical synchronization system with the notion of virtual time. It is ideal for developing collaborative serverless apps, but a tiny stateless server named reflector, on which Croquet heavily relies on still prevents doing that today. This paper presents the research, that transforms reflector into a peer-to-peer application Luminary, by implementing decentralized virtual time. The case study describes the prototype of a collaborative Rubik's Cube simulator, backed by three robots for kids. Finally showing how learners can easily experiment with augmenting physical reality, by creating fully synchronized, collaborative robots, operating in a P2P network.

AB  - The phenomenon of the water strider is suitable for teaching typical content of chemistry lessons, e.g. surface structures in interaction with the properties of water. Cross-curricular references can also be made, e.g. to body structure and locomotion on water. Using the approach of bionics, students learn how an understanding of the surface structure of water strider legs can be transferred to the synthesis of artificial structures; here the article shows references to current research in material sciences. To introduce the phenomenon itself in the most fascinating way possible, a 360 degrees film was developed for head-mounted displays and fulldomes, as well as in the classic 16:9 screen format. In order to enable the usage of the film even for secondary students, associations and student performances about the phenomenon of the water strider were collected. The results, which are presented in this article, were incorporated into the development of the film's voiceover.

AB  - COVID-19 presented the world with trauma and isolation, but many people, including educators, have offered bright spots of creativity and engagement. As we confronted these issues in our own ecology classroom, we sought solutions to carry-forward the learning objectives we set for our students in January 2020, yet encourage interaction with the sensitivity that a pandemic requires. In the rapid transition to online course delivery, we opted to retain the original end-of-semester poster project in our introductory ecology course. However, we experimented with a new virtual platform where students could disseminate their work and communicate with the community. In this paper, we discuss the Mozilla Hubs virtual reality platform that we used for our event. We also collected qualitative data to share the benefits and challenges of this experience felt by the students, the instructors, and external observers.

AB  - Large university classes often face challenges in enhancing active learning, repetition and feedback in the classroom which are essential for promoting student learning. In this study, we evaluated the implementation of digital tools (lecture recordings, question tool, classroom response system and virtual reality) regarding their perceived impact on active learning, repetition, and feedback in a large university class. The study applied a mixed methods design and collected data from a survey (95 students) and focus groups (11 students). The results show that students enjoyed using the tools because they enriched the lecture. However, students perceived differences regarding the impacts on active learning, repetition, and feedback. The perceived impacts of the classroom response system and the lecture recordings were rated high whereas the perceived impacts of the question tool and the VR modules were rated lower. Recommendations on how to use these digital tools in large classroom settings are provided.

AB  - We developed an augmented reality [AR] application in Microsoft's HoloLens platform to investigate if an AR-based assessment tool better assesses a student's real-world knowledge and skill compared to a traditional, pen-and-paper-based assessment. The AR-based assessment focused on applying knowledge to contextually subjective problems while the traditional assessment required recalling knowledge in unchanging, deterministic problems.
   Under our AR-based simulated construction scene, participants, 18 students enrolled in a Construction Management Safety course, were required to visually inspect the scene, correctly identify unsafe conditions, and justify their selections in a multiple-choice setting. After their AR-based assessment, they were required to complete a post-survey and a debrief. Also, they were required to complete the traditional assessment and pre-survey before the AR-based assessment. Our study demonstrated that the participants preferred the AR-based assessment over the traditional assessment. However, they had higher performance ratings in the traditional assessment than the AR-based assessment.

AB  - This paper presents approaches of selected chemical companies in the Czech Republic to the recruitment and methods of further staff education and training. The situation is evaluated in the context of the current Czech labour market, where there is a significant excess demand especially for employees with technical education, resulting from the economic growth. One of the ways chemical companies opt for when seeking employees is utilization of new staff search tools, education and training of recruited workers within one-off or long-term educational activities. They also take advantage of a number of forms of cooperation with schools of all levels. For example, they are getting involved in adjustment of university courses of study. The problem is made more complicated not only by the tense situation in the labour market, but also by the fast technological development, particularly by the Industry 4.0 elements and the expectation of their dramatic impact on the labour market.

AB  - Measuring cognitive load is important in virtual learning environments (VLE). Thus, valid and reliable measures of cognitive load are important to support instructional design in VLE. Through three studies, we investigated the validity and reliability of Leppink's Cognitive Load Scale (CLS) and developed the extraneous cognitive load (EL) dimension into three sub-scales relevant for VLE: EL instructions, EL interaction, and EL environment. We investigated the validity of the measures using the Partial Credit Model (PCM), Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), and correlations with retention tests. Study 1 (n= 73) investigated the adapted version of the CLS. Study 2 describes the development and validation of the Multidimensional Cognitive Load Scale for Virtual Environments (MCLSVE), with 140 students in higher education. Study 3 tested the generalizability of the results with 121 higher education students in a more complicated VLE. The results provide initial evidence for the validity and reliability of the MCLSVE.

AB  - Innovative technology has been revolutionizing the educational experience in tertiary institutions over the past decades. Using novel iBeacon Technology, a mobile application called "iClassPolyU" was developed for collecting and disseminating information to and from students. The application was employed in four medium to large classrooms and the user experience was evaluated through a survey. Usage of the application was examined through quiz completion and usage rates. Results showed that each class had a quiz completion rate of over 80%. Moreover, students believed that their physical participation could be enhanced by the application and that it was effective, easy to use, and flexible. Students proposed the inclusion of mixed reality, virtual reality, and augmented reality in the future. This type of technology provides another pathway for student learning, an opportunity to give students more control over their learning, and educators with more information regarding their students.

AB  - Animation can be used for various purposes such as for procedural and motor skill learning (i.e., dance, sports, and motor rehabilitation). In the context of visual design, this study explores the possible influence of realism (levels of visual detail) in animation at the cognitive stage of motor skill acquisition. Students (N=64) with low-prior knowledge about tennis were randomly assigned into three groups to view either 2D schematic, 3D stylised, or live-action instructional video. Their performance on the knowledge test, learning time, efficiency score, confidence level, preference, and open-ended responses were captured for analyses. Based on the findings, despite most preference towards live-action video, there was no statistically significant difference regarding cognitive learning performance among learners from different treatment groups. Hence, animated digital characters of various levels of realism can still be incorporated for motor skill acquisition especially in instructional animations, simulations, video games and virtual reality.

AB  - Although it is a relatively new innovation, 360 videos have gained commercial and public popularity. Given their novelty, there is a relative dearth of studies on their effectiveness. Most of the existing research is published as technical articles dealing with standards and specifications, as theoretical pieces promoting the potential value, or as descriptive experiences and resulting factors. Such work is arguably needed, but the field lacks deep research basis for justifying and clarifying the implementation of 360 video into practice. This article reports on a study exploring 360 videos for improving elementary mathematics teacher education. The results of the empirical study show improved immersion, presence, and video evaluation from using 360 video. Additionally, participants who viewed the videos on virtual reality headsets demonstrated increased attention to mathematical strategies in the context of teaching, demonstrating the potential usefulness of 360 headsets for perceptual capacity and teacher noticing.

AB  - Pitch perception training is one of the important aspects of music learning. Long-term training is required for improving one's sense of pitch. However, conventional standard pitch perception training is typically monotonous and is therefore prone to be unfavored by students. With advancements in multimedia technology, it is currently possible to utilize digital games in pitch perception training. In recent years, virtual reality has become a technology trend with wide application in various fields. In this paper, a pitch perception training game combining the elements of shooting game in VR environment is proposed. In the proposed game, different monsters correspondingly appear at different game levels along with a specific pitch. The player has to use a gun to select the pitch corresponding to the targeted monster using a piano-keyboard-like bullet magazine, and pull the trigger to defeat the monster. Through this game, it is expected that the player will become more motivated to participate in pitch perception training.

AB  - Desktop virtual realities are becoming increasingly widespread. Thus, it is important to measure if it can be really a next step in the evolution of computer science. This researched aimed to examine whether there is a relationship between the effectiveness of completing a task in MaxWhere VR and the users' cognitive characteristics: namely the spatial memory (measured by the Corsi-task) and the mental rotation ability. Thirty-one participants took part in this research and their results showed no relationship between the examined spatial abilities and work effectiveness. For navigating in the virtual space, the built-in CogiNav technology of MaxWhere was used. The participants rated their navigational experience in the virtual environment. There was no statistically significant relationship with the other measured variables. These results suggest that this VR can be used by anyone, independently from their spatial memory or mental rotation skill.

AB  - How can we leverage digital technologies to enhance language learning and bilingual representation? In this digital era, our theories and practices for the learning and teaching of second languages (L2) have lagged behind the pace of scientific advances and technological innovations. Here we outline the approach of digital language learning (DLL) for L2 acquisition and representation, and provide a theoretical synthesis and analytical framework regarding DLL's current and future promises. Theoretically, DLL provides a forum for understanding differences between child language and adult L2 learning, and the effects of learning context and learner characteristics. Practically, findings from learner behaviors, cognitive and affective processing, and brain correlates can inform DLL-based language pedagogies. Because of its highly interdisciplinary nature, DLL can serve as an approach to integrate cognitive, social, affective, and neural dimensions of L2 learning with new and emerging technologies including VR, AI, and big data analytics.

AB  - With the development of virtual scenes, the degree of simulation and functions of virtual reality have been very complete, providing a new platform and perspective for teaching design. Firstly, the hidden Markov chain model is used to perform emotion recognition on English speech signals. English speech emotion recognition and speech semantic recognition are essentially the same. Hidden Markov style has been widely used in English speech semantic recognition. The experiments of feature extraction and pattern recognition of speech samples prove that Hidden Markovian has higher recognition rate and better recognition effect in speech emotion recognition. Secondly, combining the human pronunciation model and the hearing model, by analyzing the impact of the glottis feature on the human ear hearing-model feature, the research application of the English speech recognition emotion interactive simulation system uses the glottis feature to compensate the human ear, hearing feature is proposed by compensated English speech recognition, and emotion interaction simulation system is used in the English speech emotion experiment, which has obtained a high recognition rate and showed excellent performance.

TI  - Using 360 degrees Video to Enable Affective Learning in Nursing Education
T2  - JOURNAL OF NURSING EDUCATION
LA  - English
AB  - Background:The affective domain describes learning associated with feelings, values, and emotions. Although this domain was first described in the late 1960s, a significant emphasis on skills and knowledge still remains. This prominence is evident despite global concerns about standards of practice and the place for empathy and care in nursing education. The emergence of newer technologies, such as 360 degrees video, provides an opportunity to revisit the design and delivery of affective learning. Method: Using the taxonomy of the affective domain, a 360 degrees video viewed through a virtual reality headset was developed to give nursing and medical students insight on the patient experience and an orientation to the operating room. Results: Careful planning and consideration of how the affective domain can inform design of learning and teaching materials resulted in an engaging and informative learning experience. Being aware of how each level of the domain informs the next is essential to develop effective affective teaching plans. Conclusion: Affective learning traditionally has been difficult to deliver and assess. Technology such as 360 degrees video provides an engaging, reproducible, and consistent platform for delivering a domain of education.

AB  - In anatomical education three-dimensional (3D) visualization technology allows for active and stereoscopic exploration of anatomy and can easily be adopted into medical curricula along with traditional 3D teaching methods. However, most often knowledge is still assessed with two-dimensional (2D) paper-and-pencil tests. To address the growing misalignment between learning and assessment, this viewpoint commentary highlights the development of a virtual 3D assessment scenario and perspectives from students and teachers on the use of this assessment tool: a 10-minute session of anatomical knowledge assessment with real-time interaction between assessor and examinee, both wearing a HoloLens and sharing the same stereoscopic 3D augmented reality model. Additionally, recommendations for future directions, including implementation, validation, logistic challenges, and cost-effectiveness, are provided. Continued collaboration between developers, researchers, teachers, and students is critical to advancing these processes. (C) 2021 The Authors.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic triggered unprecedented adoption of online education in universities and digital technologies are increasingly becoming an essential part of the learning and teaching experience. From within an ongoing pandemic 'lockdown', this study investigates the current landscape of online education with a focus on the learning and teaching experience in virtual classrooms compared to physical classrooms. We found that instructors typically combine multiple technologies to create a holistic learning experience for students. The benefits of virtual classrooms included self-paced learning, increased opportunities to gain procedural knowledge, diversified communication channels, and greater opportunities for learning analytics. Compared to physical classrooms, the drawbacks of virtual classrooms included the lack of both timely access to all information through a single interface and natural interpersonal interaction. Based on our findings we recommend instructors to remain flexible when selecting technologies and to adapt the level of offline learning to fit their students' learning styles and abilities. We also identified opportunities for virtual reality technology to mitigate the drawbacks of online education by helping to translate in-class experience to virtual spaces.

AB  - Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, education at all levels has temporarily shifted to remote learning, hobbling an integral component of chemistry courses: the laboratory. The chemistry lab is crucial for developing student engagement and learning with hands-on, relevant experiments in a socially dynamic classroom setting. The transition to remote learning consequently presents additional obstacles for chemistry educators and students, supplemental to challenges experienced by all disciplines. This article conveys preliminary indications about various remote learning laboratory scenarios by comparing three different formats for high school chemistry laboratories from the 2020 spring semester, with the aim of informing preparations for hands-on laboratory instruction in the fall. The results tentatively support that hands-on laboratory instruction should ideally occur in the classroom or, if necessary, by sending home all requisite supplies in order to promote effective, equitable learning, engagement, and performance.

AB  - Previous studies have suggested that different types of human-computer interactions (HCI) have different impact on use's emotional responses in virtual environment. In this study, we investigat the effects of two different types of HCI, including controller-based interaction and speech-based interaction, on user's emotion in a virtual counseling environment. To achieve this end, we first develop a virtual counseling environment which enable each participant acted as a counselor to help a depressed virtual woman. We then assess the emotional intensity of each participant after they experienced 2030 minutes' consultation in either controller-based or speech-based interaction condition. Our results show that, although there is no significant difference in emotional intensity between two different interaction conditions, participants in speech-based condition show relatively stronger emotion than these in controller-based condition.

AB  - Gaussian-2-Blender is an open-source application programming interface (API) written in Python that allows for the conversion of Gaussian input files to 3D objects of different formats. This new tool was developed in response to the shortcomings of available programs to import Gaussian calculations into augmented reality (AR) or virtual reality (VR) applications, which are currently rising in numbers. Gaussian-2-Blender's distinguishing features include (1) molecule renderings with proportional, scaled, and accurate atomic and ionic sizes, (2) rendering transient, hydrogen, and delocalized bonds, (3) batch conversion of multiple files, and (4) retention of Gaussian input numerical labels. These features are either not supported or difficult to achieve in other programs. The following report describes the key features of the tool and provides a comparison between this new tool and available programs.

AB  - Anatomy remains a cornerstone of medical education. It is vital that students achieve a robust understanding of the spatial relationships between anatomical structures in three dimensions. Volumetric medical imaging studies and true-color cryosectional three-dimensional images of visible human datasets are useful for enhancing anatomy education. However, the software systems available for viewing these datasets have important limitations. A web-based application called Mulrecon Color, which can overcome a number of those limitations, is introduced. Mulrecon Color enables volumetric medical and full color cryosectional datasets to be explored without requiring installation, and can therefore be used on a broad range of desktop, mobile, and even virtual reality devices. The web-based application has an interface that resembles a DICOM viewer used in radiological practice, and can be used both in anatomical labs and off campus for self-study. The Mulrecon Color application is released as an open source tool. It can be retrieved at a project website where sample datasets are also available.

AB  - The COVID-19 health crisis restrictions affecting Industrial Engineering students doing internships in laboratories and companies with training partners challenged teachers to design realistic, alternative activities where students could apply the knowledge acquired in the classroom. In this situation, the VEP (Virtual Enterprise Planning) simulator was born, which replicates the processes of a car assembly plant using ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) with elements including quality, statistics, experiment design, and problem-solving. This research involved developing the simulator design processes from ideation prototyping to product release. The simulator objective was for the students to learn specific Industrial Engineering topics about car assembly through gamification. A secondary goal was to offer students a platform to apply classroom learning to substitute factory projects and practices. Using gamification strategy, we improved learning, developed students' competencies, and increased motivation in our students. In addition, we used Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality(AR) technologies to enable the students to experience the processes and products of the Meccanos manufacturing plant. To date, 365 students have been impacted by the use of the virtual plant.

AB  - Facile visualization of biomolecules is an essential component of the undergraduate biochemistry curriculum. In the past, a number of tools have been used to display biomolecules. More recently, the advent of greater accessibility to virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) programs has created a new mechanism to visualize biomolecules. However, creation of VR and AR programs often requires extensive coding experience. In order to expand the utility of AR programs in visualization of biomolecules, we enabled undergraduate students to create their own AR protein visualization tool using an off-the-shelf program running in multiplatform smartphones or tablets to enhance student inclusivity. Assessment of this program shows that students can create their own biomolecule models, were enthusiastic about doing so, and found that their learning was enhanced when this AR module was inserted into their upper level biochemistry class. This activity could be readily adapted for remote and online learning.

AB  - In this paper we will discuss work to date on an exploratory study of tutoring patterns and their role for tutoring systems' assistance in initiating creative responses and sustaining learning. Based on classroom discourse analysis, investigation of several studies of computer assisted learning -both for single and peer learning- and our understanding of the assistance dilemma of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS), we argue that the students' need for (artificial) facilitator's help emphasizes on the manner of hint-providing, so we should take particular note of the challenges that arise from formalizing these definitions to apply to the style of problem solving and the students' different age groups. This is the first step towards a mobile ITS that utilizes eye-tracking and virtual reality glasses, in order to identify difficulties and offer on time feedback in textual or visual mode, which will be superimposed on a transparent lens in users' field of view. We will conclude with a discussion of implications and future directions.

AB  - The development of multimodal sensor-based applications designed to support learners with the improvement of their skills is expensive since most of these applications are tailor-made and built from scratch. In this paper, we show how the Presentation Trainer (PT), a multimodal sensor-based application designed to support the development of public speaking skills, can be modularly extended with a Virtual Reality real-time feedback module (VR module), which makes usage of the PT more immersive and comprehensive. The described study consists of a formative evaluation and has two main objectives. Firstly, a technical objective is concerned with the feasibility of extending the PT with an immersive VR Module. Secondly, a user experience objective focuses on the level of satisfaction of interacting with the VR extended PT. To study these objectives, we conducted user tests with 20 participants. Results from our test show the feasibility of modularly extending existing multimodal sensor-based applications, and in terms of learning and user experience, results indicate a positive attitude of the participants towards using the application (PT+VR module).

AB  - Construction professionals require to use problem-solving skills to resolve issues on projects. However, there are limited opportunities for students to practice problem-solving skills within real-world contexts. This research explored the use of iVisit - 360-degree panoramic site visits supported by virtual humans for learning problemsolving skills within difficult-to-reach construction locations. This study aimed to understand the effects of iVisit on student problem-solving skills learning using a comparative evaluation that contrasted paper-based and iVisitbased interventions. Study findings indicate that iVisit effectiveness varied depending on the methodological requirements of each situated activity. iVisit was found to significantly increase the student development of problem-solving skills during activities that require direct observation of site material properties and their spatial relationships. However, no significant differences were detected for enhancing student understanding of abstract knowledge and its relationship with site assemblies. It was also found that students with higher spatial visualization abilities performed better in problem-solving activities.

AB  - Nowadays, gamification in education is very much needed. It is because gamification will provide good motivation for students so that learning objectives can be achieved. However, the gamification usually reward-centered, and have limited scope in just giving the feedback. This research is a development of previous research that discussed virtual reality, the concept of techno family, and innovation profiling. These three concepts eventually develop into the seven stages of educational game, which will lay the concept of how gamification can be applied to achieve learning objectives. In this research, our focus is to create the concept of gamification based on the seven stages of educational game. The stages will blend into the learning activity. Gamification used to focus on rewards, however there must be a clear concept in process for earning the rewards. This research results in the concept of seven stages of educational game (educational Gamification): see, discussion, establish, build, define, decide, and expand (implementation). These seven stages will be the basis for developing further research in gamification.

AB  - This paper explores the junctional juncture between playable digital interventions and urban public spatial design. Ubiquitous mobile digital devices and their pervasiveness in daily life are creating a shift in the traditional uses of urban public spaces and redefining how play occurs in urban public spaces. Activating possibilities of play in public space encourages people to go on a spontaneous and amorphous way of discovering new things in daily life relying on awareness, taking one's time, reflecting, experimenting, exploring, etc. Utilising the framework of playable digital interaction and exploring urban spatial environment narrative literature, twenty-five existing and proposed playable digital interventions in urban public space are studied to develop an initial typology. This typology includes characteristics such as diverse interactive mechanism, experience, and spatial features. This classification of playful digital interventions in urban public spaces will enable urban planners, designers, decision-makers, game designers, and researchers to realise the great potential and conceptualize the design of future digital playable installations for public spaces.

AB  - As game-based learning continues to draw attention, students' perceptions toward classroom activities are vital in influencing the quality of learning. This study used the social cognitive theory to show the perception traits of learning and playing in game-based environments and for students to identify their self-efficacy toward game-based learning by different trait groups. The game Formosa Hope was used in an experiment with 362 fifth- and sixth-grade students at ages 11 to 12 years as participants. Three perception traits were identified through a two-step cluster analysis: I-strong perceptions of learning and playing, II-moderate perceptions of learning and playing, and III-strong perception of playing but weak perception of learning. This study showed that regardless of trait type, students demonstrated positive self-efficacy, with those with Trait I having significantly higher self-efficacy than those with Traits II and III, indicating that students' positive perceptions of learning and playing are essential in prompting self-efficacy in game-based learning.

AB  - This study examined the effects of virtual and physical robots (VPR) using in different learning stages (simple session/complex session) in a robotics programming course. A quasi-experimental design was implemented with 84 junior high school students from two classes. One class with 44 students used combination of VPR strategy for learning, whereas the other class with 42 students used only physical robots (the PR strategy) to learn the same content materials. Results showed that no significant difference was found in the students' learning attitude, programming skills, and learning engagement between VPR and PR, while significant difference existed in engineering design ability and cognitive load, no matter in simple or complex learning sessions. Although the VPR strategy is not always better than the PR one, it has unique advantages on facilitating students' higher-order thinking in solving complex problem, as well as reducing their cognitive load. These findings highlight that VPR is more valuable to the engineering design tasks than PR, and indicate a potential direction in the future to integrate Virtual Reality/Augment Reality into robotics education.

AB  - In March 2020, near the onset of the COVID-19 related lockdowns, quarantine, and isolation measures being taken worldwide, we noticed an increasing number of graphs, diagrams, images and mathematical models relating to the pandemic posted on our Facebook walls. For the purposes of this paper, we selected a number of these Facebook posts to discuss and analyse, through the lens of questions based in critical mathematics education research. Our analyses draw attention to public discourse(s) around mathematics, as well as how numbers, graphs, diagrams, and images are used on Facebook. In our analyses, we first identify the mathematics topic/concept being depicted through the image and, second, how that Facebook post might serve as an artefact of critical mathematics education. In doing so, we challenge the usual separation of mathematics classrooms from the real world and highlight how, in this time of pandemic, life is less real than it is surreal; it is less real than it is virtual.

AB  - This qualitative case study investigates graduate students' perspective changes apropos their cross-national collaborative learning experience while participating in an online teaching and learning course jointly taught by graduate schools in the United States and Israel. The participants met virtually, on a weekly basis between November and December 2018, on a platform called Second Life, to design and participate in collaborative learning activities. On completion of the course, interviews were conducted with a small sample of student-participants regarding their experiences. During the design phase, participants' dominant perceptions of their learning experiences were characterized by genuine "excitement" at the novelty of collaborating virtually with colleagues on the other side of the world. Their initial perceptions evolved during the participation phase to realization as learning communities emerged and students' roles expanded beyond the scope of mere participants. In this study, the authors argue that participants' construction of new knowledge resulted in authentic learning from the standpoints of social constructivism and online collaborative learning theory and further discuss the factors that enabled the participants' authentic learning experience.

AB  - The use of video games in the foreign language classroom is becoming an emerging tendency. This paper aims at analysing how the serious video game ImmerseMe influences the learning of Spanish as a foreign language within a group of 22 Chinese students. This research was conducted through an experiment that included testing participants' progress (group 1) before and after completing a five-lesson plan using the aforementioned video game, this being compared with a group of 26 Chinese students (group 2). Based on the content of the selected lessons, the main purpose of this test was to determine the participants' initial level and then assess their progress considering the mistakes that they made regarding the word order structure, lexicon, grammar, spelling, and content. The results have shown that all the participants in group 1 progressed in the second test after completing the lessons through ImmerseMe, and their performances were generally better than those of group 2. In conclusion, it seems that the use of serious video games such as ImmerseMe can be a useful tool in the educational field of foreign language learning and teaching.

AB  - We tested a new method for creating virtual geological field trips by using 3D panoramic virtual reality (PVR) techniques to develop a program exploring Mudeung UNESCO Global Geopark, South Korea. The geological features of the Mesozoic Cretaceous rocks include dinosaur footprints of the Jangdong Formation, beautiful Hwasun Cliff, Mudeung Tuff and quartz granite. The Mt. Mudeung is a progressive model of the Mesozoic igneous activity and is an excellent geological study area. This paper provide information on the development, organization, content, interactive controls, and other key aspects of the geological filed trips and landscapes. The 360 degrees x 180 degrees model can be accessed via PCs or smartphones and be freely rotated and zoomed. This method allows rapid virtual exploration of the area's geological features, allowing students to explore the local strata and other information. It also assists student learning by providing enlarged interactive images, pop-up windows with additional information, and expert explanations of important observational points. Programs of this type can be used as remote learning materials that address common problems with physical geological field trips like cost, safety, and distance to enhance earth science at many levels.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: In this study we aim to evaluate the feasibility of creating volumetric models of highly intricate skull-base anatomy-previously not amenable to volumetric reconstruction-using endoscopic endonasal approaches.
   METHODS: Ten human cadaveric heads were dissected through the nasal corridor to expose anterior, middle, and posterior cranial fossi structures and the pterygopalatine and infratemporal fossi. A rigid endoscope with a 30 degrees lens was used to capture the images. Subsequently, a photogrammetry software was used to align, smooth, and texturize the images into a complete 3-dimensional model.
   RESULTS: An average of 174 photographs were used to construct each model (n = 10). In the end, we achieved high-definition stereoscopic volumetric models of the nasal corridor; paranasal fossae; and anterior, middle and posterior fossae structures that preserved structural integrity. Strategic points of interests were labeled and animated for educational use.
   CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic volumetric models represent a new way to depict the anatomy of the skull base; their use with 3-dimensional technologies could potentially improve the visuospatial understanding of narrow surgical corridors for education and surgical-planning purposes.

AB  - Academic geography is the nexus for geospatial learning and research on many college and university campuses. Along with offering courses and programs in established areas such as geographic information systems and remote sensing, geography instruction and research have increasingly used new or emerging geospatial technologies (EGTs) for capturing, processing, and visualizing spatial data. Examples of EGTs include unoccupied aircraft systems, location-based services, and virtual reality devices. Although EGTs are expanding rapidly within higher education institutions, we know less about the nature of their adoption within geography instruction and research. For example, which EGTs are most firmly established and in what project domains (data capture, data analysis, and data delivery) are they used most frequently? In this article, we present findings from a Web-based survey of U.S. and Canadian geography departments and programs aimed at exploring the adoption and use of EGTs. Among other results, our findings suggest that EGTs are often employed across more than one project domain. Along with assessing rates of adoption and frequency of use, we examine sources of funding used in the acquisition of EGTs.

IFP School has been producing MOOCs since 2014 introducing innovative pedagogical techniques to improve learner motivation by integrating games into our MOOC's.
   In our latest MOOC: 'Tomorrow's Mobility', in addition to the gaming element that has proven to be successful, storytelling techniques were used that created a narrative thread which was integrated with the technical knowledge that was presented. A charming character was created that accompanied the learners throughout the entire MOOC resulting in a special relationship between the learners and the MOOC course.
   In this paper we describe how this MOOC was built through the use of this character and the other pedagogical innovation that was introduced. The results show an unusual environment that increased the learners motivation to help the character. Since helping the character meant going through the different activities proposed in the MOOC, in our opinion, it was the main reason that led to the high completion rate of 20% that was obtained.

AB  - Digital learning environments play an important role in learning. Nevertheless, this field is still relatively unexplored. As a private educational company, it is important for us to offer our participants the best learning environment in terms of knowledge acquisition but also in motivation. In times of rapidly evolving technologies, the question arises, what should an effective learning environment look like? What effects do we want to achieve among the learners? What role does the target audience play? Are there any differences in motivation, volition and personality? The learning itself has changed and with that also the expectations of our learners have changed. We use state-of-the-art technology and can learn anywhere. All these aspects need to be considered when developing a virtual learning and working environment. There are also challenges in the use of new technology and the design of courses and seminars. This paper contains experiences and solutions that can be valuable in the development, deployment and scientific evaluation of a virtual learning environment.

AB  - This article aims to analyze the potential of new technologies in the area of green chemistry didactics. When viewed through the lens of systems thinking, the use of these ubiquitous tools can be a driving force for the development of a sustainable world because of their global use and reach. The authors concentrate on flat e-learning platforms, social media tools, virtual reality platforms, and machinima, as these tools enable learners to participate in different interdisciplinary topics and exercise habits that trigger behavioral changes through learning by doing or learning from mistakes. To demonstrate the potential of innovative didactic tools, examples of mini scenarios for the development of chemistry lessons are provided, and these scenarios promote the sustainability concept and systems thinking. The authors conclude that the pursuit of sustainability goals in chemistry education should involve extended thinking about instructional design and asymmetries in technology use, as well as incorporate green teaching into the principles of green chemistry.

AB  - The adoption of digital technology in both learning and teaching process, and the evolution of information technologies are opening new perspectives for the use of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR). Thus, these technologies can facilitate the assistance of learners working on complex learning situation by using AR and enable the implementation of VR trainings, thus improving their efficiency. However, integrating these new tools into the existing learning processes remains complex, due to the technological aspects and the data continuum to be implemented, through the identification of use cases and the associated gains and by the diversity actors and experts to involve in this process: the expert of the main field, the designer and the IT developer. In this paper we aim to develop an AR application by following a developing process that will led to the planned results. The proposed application will be dictated for learners in higher education context, especially newbies that will practice their first experiment in the laboratory e.g." biology, chemistry" by giving them an interactive environment to understand the safety procedure followed during experiments in laboratories.

AB  - Dealing with the often-overwhelming nature of the school placement experience and the associated demands of classroom management can be a significant challenge for many pre-service teachers. These challenges point to the need for pre-service teachers to experience aspects of challenging pupil behaviour in less pressurised environments and where they can have the opportunities to make mistakes without fear of negative repercussions on their academic progression. The use of virtual simulations is increasingly seen as an opportunity to provide pre-service teachers with unique opportunities to experience examples of classroom life in a controlled and structured environment. With these benefits in mind, this paper explores the growing use of virtual simulations in pre-service teacher education and in particular their use in developing pre-service teachers' behaviour and classroom management skills. It highlights issues that teacher educators need to be cognisant of in using them with student teachers, particularly the extent to which they cement existing stereotypes about pupil behaviour and the extent to which they subsequently limit rather than enhance opportunities for critical reflection.

AB  - This study aimed to identify and rank the serious game fidelity themes that should be considered for retaining both the learning potential and predicted market growth of serious games. The authors also investigated existing links between fidelity and AI. The methodology unraveled serious game fidelity through the co-development of a theory- and data-driven codebook, applying the constant comparison method for data analysis. The theory-driven codes stemmed from literature while the data-driven codes emerged from a heuristic user interface evaluation of a comic book style game, named ExMan. This article identifies five fidelity themes, with functional fidelity as most important, and postulates that functional fidelity is most suited to AI integration. This study delivers a fidelity-for-serious-games codebook and concludes that observing the suggested fidelity hierarchy could safeguard that neither digital game-based learning is watered down, nor the lustre of digital gameplay dulled. Furthermore, the authors hold that AI for serious games should be given a high design priority.

AB  - Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, in-person undergraduate chemistry laboratories at North Carolina State University were not available to students during the 2020-2021 academic year and were replaced with online laboratories. With the return to in-person laboratories in the fall semester of 2021, there was widespread concern among the faculty that chemistry majors might struggle with the application of concepts and techniques that they learned online in the in-person lab environment. An event to bring students back to campus for a day was designed by the faculty in charge of teaching organic and analytical chemistry laboratories with extensive input from students. Participants were asked to choose the lab techniques that they wanted to review, were given agency to choose the day and time of the gathering, and were encouraged to suggest a name for the event. In this paper we describe the outcomes regarding student choices, participation, and self-assessed efficacy before and after testing in person the lab techniques that had been learned online.

AB  - This article explores the effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic on the evolution of both physical and digital cadavers within the unique ecosystem of the anatomy laboratory. A physical cadaver is a traditional and established learning tool in anatomy education, whereas a digital cadaver is a relatively recent phenomenon. The Covid-19 pandemic presented a major disturbance and disruption to all levels and types of education, including anatomy education. This article constructs a conceptual metaphor between a typical anatomy laboratory and an ecosystem, and considers the affordances, constraints, and changing roles of physical and digital cadavers within anatomy education through an ecological lens. Adaptation of physical and digital cadavers during the disturbance is analyzed, and the resiliency of digital cadaver technology is recognized. The evolving role of the digital cadaver is considered in terms of increasing accessibility and inclusivity within the anatomy laboratory ecosystem of the future.

AB  - This paper studies the impact of gender on the interest in engineering and technical subjects of the students in the first courses of secondary education. A statistical analysis was carried out, analyzing the use of a free virtual-reality application, developed by the 3M Foundation, which aims to bring these subjects to the students. Non-parametric statistical methods were used to analyze several variables, such as repetition of the experience, new learning and knowledge reinforcement as well as learning in different ways, which were collected through two questionnaires. These were Pre and Post the playing of the game and later, subsequently validated. This analysis demonstrated that gender has an impact on the interest of the students in engineering and technology but it does not have any influence on the rest of the studied variables. The results show that the interest of girls could be increased through group activities. Age has only influence on the desire to repeat the experience, with a varied level of influence, in the case of the technological contents. The motivational factors that have a greater influence on each variable, "innovation" and "usefulness", were also analyzed.

AB  - Visualization of three-dimensional (3D) elements has always played a huge role in chemistry education. At the same time, it is a challenge to teach with most representations being shown in two-dimensional (2D) media. With the recent rise of extended reality (XR) that includes virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR) technology in higher education, attempts have been made at presenting 2D representations to students in a manner that is easier to understand. However, the effectiveness of said attempts has limitations. Our AR project has developed a free-to-use mobile application "Nucleophile's Point of View" (NuPOV) that aims to address these limitations. By allowing users to not only view chemistry concepts in an AR setting but also interact with them by hand, they are able to learn and understand at a deeper level through an individualized and self-directed learning experience. Our study has shown that such an approach proved to be relatively well-received by students.

AB  - The transformations in educational environments due to the immersion of information and communication technologies (ICT) make it necessary to analyze the limits and possibilities of the assessment of the virtual training process. This paper presents an analysis of the meanings of ICT-mediated assessment, establishing what kinds of knowledge are suitable for this type of evaluation, and the challenges and possibilities of virtual tools. For this, we present a systematic review of ICT-mediated evaluation and assessment according to the educational paradigms and their implementation. We highlight that contemporary pedagogical models and their implementation in ICT mediation tools show a trend towards quantitative and summative valuation. The commonly used learning management systems (LMS) include several types of questions oriented to quantitative evaluation, with multiple-choice being the most common. However, new technological approaches like gamification, virtual reality and mobile learning open new assessment possibilities. The ICT educational platforms and new technologies demand new skills for all educational actors, such as digital literacy.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) and computational sciences have aroused a growing interest in education. Despite its relatively recent history, AI is increasingly being introduced into the classroom through different modalities, with the aim of improving student achievement. Thus, the purpose of the research is to analyse, quantitatively and qualitatively, the impact of AI components and computational sciences on student performance. For this purpose, a systematic review and meta-analysis have been carried out in WOS and Scopus databases. After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the sample was set at 25 articles. The results support the positive impact that AI and computational sciences have on student performance, finding a rise in their attitude towards learning and their motivation, especially in the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) areas. Despite the multiple benefits provided, the implementation of these technologies in instructional processes involves a great educational and ethical challenge for teachers in relation to their design and implementation, which requires further analysis from the educational research. These findings are consistent at all educational stages.

AB  - Ubiquity of information technology is undoubtedly the most substantial change to society in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries and has resulted in a paradigm shift in how business and social interactions are conducted universally. Information dissemination and acquisition is now effortless, and the way we visualise information is constantly evolving. The face of anatomy education has been altered by the advent of such innovation with Technology-Enhanced Learning (TEL) now commonplace in modern curricula.
   With the constant development of new computing systems, the temptation is to push the boundaries of what can be achieved rather than addressing what should be achieved. As with clinical practice, education in healthcare should be evidence driven. Learning theory has supplied educators with a wealth of information on how to design teaching tools, and this should form the bedrock of technology-enhanced educational platforms. When analysing resources and assessing if they are fit for purpose, the application of pedagogical theory should be explored and the degree to which it has been applied should be considered.

AB  - Modern technologies are often utilised in schools or universities with a variety of educational goals in mind. Of particular interest is the enhanced interactivity and engagement offered by mixed reality devices such as the HoloLens, as well as the ability to explore anatomical models of disease using augmented and virtual realities. As the students are required to learn an ever-increasing number of diseases within a university health science or medical degree, it is crucial to consider which technologies provide value to educators and students. This chapter explores the opportunities for using modern disruptive technologies to teach a curriculum surrounding disease. For relevant examples, a focus will be placed on asthma as a respiratory disease which is increasing in prevalence, and stroke as a neurological and cardiovascular disease. The complexities of creating effective educational curricula around these diseases will be explored, along with the benefits of using augmented reality and mixed reality as viable teaching technologies in a range of use cases.

AB  - As a result of the development of digital tools, all segments of society are constantly changing, the systems supporting the identification and analysis of social problems, to which the methodology of education must also be adapted. Continuous renewal also requires the use of state-of-the-art technologies in the field of training. Many emerging digital technologies offer opportunities for this, including virtual reality, augmented reality, and virtualized simulation environments. These technologies can be successful if society can reap the benefits, learn about them and incorporate their use into their daily activities. Modern teaching methods are essential in mastering the effective use of new technologies, and the application and success of these methods indudes the issue of timeliness and effectiveness, which is also the subject of the present study. The present study focuses primarily on the benefits of simulation environments, which fundamentally determine the competencies of engineers building the digital society of the future. The study also presents the results of a quantitative study, the results of which show that modern competence development methods based on simulation may be even more effective.

AB  - There is a growing interest in emerging technologies such as VR among practitioners from different sectors, including education and social welfare, given these technologies may enhance the experience of their service targets, and may be easily adopted by ordinary users. Additionally, the barriers of users' adoption are also lowering. Nevertheless, not-for-profit organizations may find significant barriers for developing their emerging technological applications, which are largely due to the resources and capabilities required. As a result, the adoption of these emerging technologies by not-for-profit organizations (NPO) is yet to be seen. Through a case-study in Scout Association of Hong Kong, we have learnt that NPOs might develop and adopt different emerging technological applications to fit their needs by collaborating with the universities, possibly with students' capstone project as a medium. These collaborations will be beneficial to not only the NPOs but also to the students and the university. Based on our findings, we also highlighted a few lessons for these collaborations.

AB  - Current research calculates the time between development of new evidence-based knowledge into established clinical practice as 17 years. This is the knowledge translation gap. The factors influencing this delay are multiple, but it is clear across the history of medicine that knowledge from new, well-constructed studies does not lead directly to change. A significant factor within the knowledge translation gap is the nature of the presentations as they are currently delivered. In the 1999 film The Matrix, there is a discussion between two characters regarding the concept that the world we perceive is, in fact, a virtual reality. As we inhabit this construct, we have a fleeting awareness that the world may not be as we perceive it, but the truth of what that entails is overwhelming. The implicit beliefs underpinning a presentation are that reading out a presentation is teaching, and the corollary, that listening to that presentation is learning. The evidence in the psychological and educational literature is clear that this is false. The implications of this are significant. This is The Matrix of knowledge translation.

AB  - The coronavirus pandemic has had a significant influence on medical education, most notably in terms of content delivery and provision of assessments. These unique times have facilitated the introduction of many new educational methods in medical schools globally each of which with potential merits and drawbacks. Importantly, the use of remote platforms to carry out online teaching has been especially vital in ensuring the continued training of doctors but other techniques such as telemedicine, online clinical case repositories and even virtual reality headsets are also being used to overcome these difficult circumstances. Some institutions also opted for open book written examinations raising issues surrounding this format's legitimacy and potential benefits. Practical examinations are even harder to facilitate and although most were cancelled, this crisis may result in innovation which changes their future format. For example some may include audible clinical signs played online through a computer speaker to replace clinical examination. Overall, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused an overhaul of medical school orthodoxy that whilst disruptive, may serve to expose institutions to novel means of teaching and assessment which may ultimately improve medical education in future.

AB  - Ever since they were established, schools and the teaching they entail have always been burdened by their progressive role. Progressive reformers were preoccupied with a pedagogical interpretation of the Paedocentric concept of education and the teaching methodology and methodological operationalization of the so-called child-centred method. The premise of pedagogical Progressivism was that education is based on the fact that the best way for people, as social beings, to learn and acquire knowledge is by engaging in real life activities. Processes of acquiring new knowledge occur with increasing frequency outside the formerly known didactic organizational scheme. If schools do not adapt quickly, they are bound to lose this race. Does progress, in the sense of teaching improvement, presume innovations in the educational technology, the teaching organization, or would progress in pedagogy mean something completely different today? As soon as we pose the question of quality, we raise questions of not only organization of the educational process but also the meaning and manner of learning and teaching in the era in which everything is relative, when all values fluctuate and everything becomes mutable and impermanent because of the influence of technology, media and virtual reality.

AB  - Teaching chemistry without access to a traditional laboratory space is an ongoing challenge that has become especially relevant because of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. While several remote learning options exist for covering general chemistry concepts (including kitchen-based experiments, online modules, and virtual reality), few options provide opportunities for hands-on learning about the chemistry of synthetic polymer materials. Here, we offer remote learning modules that use household adhesives as a platform for teaching polymer chemistry outside of the laboratory. These modules are designed for students who have taken at least one semester of organic chemistry and have varied hands-on time commitments, ranging from 2 to 10 total hours each. Concepts covered include polymer synthesis, intermolecular interactions, thermomechanical properties, structure-function relationships, and molecular design. The experiments described in these modules also give students a chance to practice research-relevant skills such as searching for primary literature sources, fabricating test samples, explaining unexpected experimental results, and revising experimental procedures to improve methodologies. Ultimately, these modules provide educators with an additional tool for teaching experimental chemistry outside of the laboratory.

AB  - Objectives: The extent of medical knowledge increases yearly, but the time available for students to learn is limited, leading to administrative pressures to revise and reconfigure medical school curricula. The goal of the present study is to determine whether the mixed reality platform HoloAnatomy represents an effective and time-efficient modality to learn anatomy when compared to traditional cadaveric dissection. Methods: This was a prospective, longitudinal study of medical students completing a musculoskeletal anatomy course at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine. Participants were divided into two groups based on learning platform (HoloAnatomy versus traditional cadaveric dissection) and content area (upper limb versus lower limb anatomy). Time spent in lab and end of course practical exam scores were compared between groups. Results: The average study time of 48 medical students who completed study requirements was 4.564 h using HoloAnatomy and 7.318 h in the cadaver lab (p = 0.001). No significant difference was found between exam scores for HoloAnatomy and cadaver learners (p = 0.185). Conclusions: Our results indicate that HoloAnatomy may decrease the time necessary for anatomy didactics without sacrificing student understanding of the material.

AB  - The objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) is a format of examination that enables students to be evaluated in a uniform, standardized, reliable, and objective way. It is carried out in different clinical stations that simulate real clinical situations and scena-rios. Numerous universities in Spain and other countries employ this approach for the final examination for medical school students. This update describes the organization, design, and fundamentals for the OSCE, proposing that radiology should form part of multidisciplinary OSCEs to the extent that it forms part of clinical practice. Moreover, it is interesting and opportune to introduce the OSCE in undergraduate and postgraduate training in radiology. Online platforms enable bidimensional OSCEs that are cost-effective in terms of staff, resources, and physical space, although this approach has certain limitations. Virtual world technologies make it possi-ble to reproduce OSCE stations in three-dimensional scenarios; recent experiences in radiology have shown that this approach interests and motivates students and is widely accepted by them.

AB  - Collaborative problem-solving skills are required from learners in the 21st century, particularly in construction graduates upon entering the workforce. However, challenges associated with spatiotemporal contexts of construction sites and resource limitations of educational programs reduce the opportunities available for students to practice these skills. This study focuses on using 360-degree panoramic virtual environments enhanced with virtual humans to produce realistic site visits for practicing collaborative problem-solving opportunities (iVisit-Collaborate). The goal of this phenomenological research study is to understand the collaborative problem-solving process of student dyads within iVisit-Collaborate. The findings suggest that student collaborative behaviors did not directly result in successful problem-solving. A hierarchical relationship between student problem-solving and collaborative behaviors was observed, indicating that problem-solving behaviors must take place to enable the occurrence of collaborative behaviors. Moreover, it was also observed that instructor scaffolding helped reduce the degrees of freedom in complex problem-solving activities. Finally, it was observed that student discussion engagement supported the creation and maintenance of shared mental models.

AB  - This study uses bibliometrics and social network analysis methods to investigate the characteristics of the most cited research papers in the Web of Science (WoS) database in virtual patient (VP) studies in interactive learning environments. We identify the most cited studies from the WoS database and then visualize and analyze the research data using bibliometric analysis and VOSviewer. The studies in the dataset were published in 294 different journals in 17 countries between 1989 and 2020. The highest-volume journal was found to be Medical Teacher, and the United States (US) was the country with the highest yield of published studies. The most frequent keywords were virtual patients, simulation, virtual reality, and medical education. The research results show that publishing articles in journals with high impact factors improves the quality of research. The trends in VP research further lay the foundation of bibliometrics for scholars and identify researchers, scientific journals, countries, hot topics, and relevant fields for VP literature. The most cited research uncovers new horizons in the field, providing research inspiration for investigators.

AB  - Learning technology procurement process proposes many challenges for both public authorities buying hardware and software, but also for the technology companies providing them to the market. In this research, innovation procurement methodology was applied to accelerate the dialogue between supply and demand in the learning technology market. In order to make cost effective procurement decisions, schools and municipalities need to engage hands on into the testing and also co-creating the innovations developing on artificial intelligence, robotics and virtual reality. Similarly, even the most advanced technologies cannot be successfully created for users without participatory design. This study brings forwards the future learning technology needs of over 1300 students and teachers from seven countries around Europe: Spain, Portugal, Italy, Germany, Hungary, Sweden and Finland. The results show that ease-of-use is still forgotten in many learning technologies and what qualifies `innovation' in the real classroom is something simple, saving the teachers' time for example, rather than a gadget which is not used after the first week's enthusiasm has faded.

AB  - Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) are currently undergoing a fast development. Analysis of this trend should be taken into consideration while creating or modifying curricula for students in higher education (HE). The adaptation of curricula has to correspond with the requirements of the labour market - ICT employers. The increase in interest in technologies is also visible in scientific articles.
   The aim of the paper is a systematic research analysis of the development of selected ICT technologies and taking results into account during the creation of the curricula for the undergraduate degree in Computer Science. Developing technologies were chosen for further study using trends analyses made by research and advisory companies, and the brainstorming method among ICT experts. The following emerging technologies/phenomena were selected: artificial intelligence, deep learning, machine learning, cloud computing, blockchain, chatbot, Internet of things, Internet of everything, intelligent interface, multiplatform, virtual reality, e-commerce, and DevOps.
   The research was conducted on two scientific databases: Web of Knowledge and Scopus. In each of them, the number of articles was searched in 2015-2019 by providing relevant keywords adapted to ICT areas. The obtained results are presented in this paper. They were used to change the Computer Science undergraduate curriculum by modifying the content of current courses and introducing new ones.

AB  - Interactive learning experiences are becoming the standard for today's 'tech-savvy' generation of students and an important issue for research in instructional technology. The design and implementation of higher education, incorporating interactive technologies, can be difficult and often requires high levels of design knowledge. Our intent is to assist researchers, instructors and designers in identifying an effective methodology to design interactive learning contents that use recent interactive technologies, in particular 360 degrees video, and encourage greater student engagement. In this study, 360 degrees videos have been designed and implemented in an engineering program but the design methodology we suggest can be apply in any industrial or educational context. Then, 360 degrees videos have been evaluated by the students as highly immersive and engaged environments that surround them and offer them an increased sense of presence, giving them a 360-degree view of the environment. In this type of video, viewers no longer only look at a single screen, they can point the camera lens wherever they want, allowing viewers to watch the video from multiple perspectives (active), rather than only from the director's point of view (passive).

AB  - E-learning has taken center stage during this period of social distancing and lockdowns, in the current pandemic, by enabling education to continue. There are perceptibly no limitations to the utility of e-learning tools in the cognitive domain of learning. It complements traditional learning in other domains, namely, psychomotor, affective and communication skill, fairly well. Not only does it ease learning in terms of availability and accessibility, but with the options of asynchronous learning and personalization of content, it also empowers learners with more autonomy. Despite the limitation of lack of 'hands-on' training and experience with e-learning, it has been accepted quite well, although initially both teachers and learners had been skeptical about its applicability and quality. In the ongoing pandemic period, e-learning may assume a bigger role as blended learning in medical education. While this transition may be smooth for the better resourced nations who already have the required infrastructure and resources ready, the resource limited nations may first have to develop the same before being able to implement it. Ensuring the availability of cheap and high-speed internet, computers in various forms (desktops, laptops, tablets and smartphones) within reach of every learner, will enable them to go online.

AB  - Previous studies have demonstrated evidence that three-dimensional (3D) visualization techniques can be helpful as learning tools. This prospective randomized control study was designed to test the hypothesis that 3D learning tools would have improved translation into interpreting normal and abnormal canine abdominal radiographic images over traditional learning tools. Sagittal and dorsal plane 3D image scenes were created from CT scans, with canine abdominal organs labeled using virtual reality and 3D visualization software tools. Eighty students from the first- and second-year veterinary classes at a single institution participated in the study. The control group studied canine abdominal anatomy from a textbook and the experimental group studied canine abdominal anatomy using the 3D learning tools for a set time. Each participant then took a three-part written examination to assess their learning for the following categories: 3D anatomy organ identification, radiographic anatomy organ identification of normal structures and radiographic anatomy organ identification of abnormal structures. All participants were also asked to identify the sex of the test patient from the 3D study. Participants from the experimental group performed statistically better than participants in the control group for all parts of the examination, with the exception of normal radiographic anatomy.

AB  - Background. The recent application of blended educational methods has impacted medical education and has drawn attention to a new teaching method. This teaching style presents unique opportunities and challenges. We investigated the effects of blended learning and traditional teaching methods on clinical skill development.
   Methods. We sorted 200 medical students from Tongji Medical College at Huazhong University of Science and Technology into a control or experimental group. The control group was taught with a traditional lecture-based learning method and the experimental group was taught using a blended learning method. The two groups were compared after training to assess their theoretical and practical differences. A student satisfaction survey was given to participants in both groups.
   Results. The results of the experimental group's theoretical and practical assessments were found to be significantly higher (p < 0.05) than that of the control group. The student satisfaction survey showed that blended learning was significantly more effective for acquiring relevant knowledge, enhancing student-centered learning and improving clinical practice.
   Conclusions. Blended learning may address deficiencies in clinical skills, make up for limited time and space, and ensure learning efficiency and quality.

AB  - Based on the existing theoretical body of knowledge of post-modern (constructivisms) and contextual (communities) learning paradigms and in our previous research [1], this presentation pretends to discuss some ideas for the strategic management of learning contexts embodied as virtual (learning) communities, namely that:
   The creation of a (virtual learning) community is a collective exercise of imagination based upon the principles of collective construction and of collective transaction.
   The management of a community, envisioned as a learning context, involves the management of the technological, relational and pedagogical contexts of the "non-place" in which the community develops.
   For that purpose, it proposes to present:
   A brief review of the community learning paradigm in the light of three complementary perspectives: the fragmentary and imaginary character of modern identities and communities (the desconstructivist approach); the new forms, concepts and indicators of community in virtual reality (the [social]constructivist) and the concept of context as a transactional relationship (contextual approach).
   The theoretical assumptions and considerations that translate our view about the creation of virtual learning communities.
   To conclude, it will elaborate on some general guidelines for the creation and management of virtual learning communities resulting from the observation of the phenomenon of managing online learning communities.

AB  - The impact of mobility restrictions due to the coronavirus pandemic in the year 2020 altered all the planned activities of the MSc Energy for Smart Cities in four European locations (Stockholm, Leuven, Grenoble and Barcelona) with a majority of non-European students. In addition, the master programme has specific activities where students join together in three European cities (Barcelona, Antwerp and Amsterdam). The response was to immediately introduce online tools with two relevant pedagogical innovations. The first one, Immersive Learning, addressed to overcome as much as possible the experience of living in the cities that couldn't be visited. The solution implemented has been designed to be simple and low cost in order to ensure the maximum reasonable value. The second innovation has been to take advantage of the pandemic obstacles to evolve the Challenge Based Learning towards a new methodology were students actively assume the role of defining the challenges, aligned with their interests and motivations, keeping the connection with the companies and institutions involved in the innovation and startup ecosystem. The positive effect of those innovations has been to increase the engagement and motivation of students despite the difficult situation.

AB  - Although multiple consensus statements have called for large-scale efforts to improve clinicians' communication skills regarding a variety of difficult conversations in medicine, this goal will be difficult to attain because there are no readily scalable, validated communication skills training programs for clinicians. However, novel applications of existing technologies and approaches grounded in learning science can overcome the scalability barriers. Moreover, future advances in virtual reality and artificial intelligence are likely to greatly enhance the possibilities for communication skills training programs. The purpose of this paper is to propose a scalable, theoretically grounded method to train clinicians in advanced communication skills in medicine. First, we summarize four key principles of adult learning relevant to communication skills training in medicine. Second, we discuss recommended practices to design effective technology-enhanced educational interventions, with an emphasis on achieving high amounts of user engagement. Third, we synthesize these principles into a framework for a web- and videoconference-based platform for teaching advanced communication skills in medicine. Once developed, this low-cost, scalable training platform has the potential to allow thousands of clinicians to acquire the advanced communication skills needed for difficult conversations in medicine.

T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY

KW  - MULTILITERACIES
KW  - IDEOLOGIES
AB  - In this paper, I consider a social movement for animal rights as a site of learning about a particular form of ethics. I use a multiliteracies framework, which emphasizes critical consumption and creation across a range of media forms, to consider how learning unfolds using a different kind of medium: the affective body. Activists in this study learned to read the signs of their embodied encounters with nonhuman animals as a privileged mode for understanding their ethical truth. Then they used other forms of digital mediation to produce and spread the feelings of being present with animals for others. I discuss social media memes and virtual reality as two examples. I employ the term "im-mediacy" to emphasize both the affects of feeling present and the sense-making involved in mediation and its ideologies. This approach considers affect and semiosis as mutually constitutive processes in learning. The findings also suggest the need to consider the affects produced in learning environments that bring bodies in proximity to one another, or that use technology to mediate feelings of proximity, as well as what I describe as embodied literacies for sensing the needs of others and responding with care.

AB  - Competency-based university teaching offers a framework for the comprehensive development of future educators, promoting an integration of knowledge, skills and values in various contexts. This study aims to identify previous experiences, relevant situations and technological resources for the development of innovation, communication and digital competences, considering the perspective of postgraduate students of education. The methodological approach was qualitative, through a self-report with open questions. The participants were 97 students from a Spanish public university, involved in a University Master's Degree in Research in Strategies and Technologies for the Teaching Function in Multicultural Society, during the 2018, 2019 and 2020 courses. After analyzing the students' responses to the open questions, results show the variety of didactic methodologies in the development of the innovation (project-based learning, cooperative learning) and communicative (assembly, dramatization) competencies. The emphasis placed on learning communities is frequent in identifying innovative prior experiences and exemplifying the domain of digital competence. The article concludes highlighting the competency mosaic generated from the 25 categories that represent experiences of educational innovation (creativity, interdisciplinary projects), didactic communication situations (interculturality, non-verbal communication) and repertoire of digital resources (blog, social networks, apps, virtual reality) illustrating relevant practices in educational contexts.

AB  - This paper provides a comprehensive review of the features and trends of personalised learning. The review covers a total of 203 journal articles collected from Scopus, which were published from 2001 to 2018 and involved personalised learning practices. Comparing the practices between 2001-2009 and 2010-2018, there was a clear trend that they became more diversified in terms of the educational levels and modes of education, as well as the means to achieve personalised learning, their objectives and the devices used. In most practices, the use of technology was clearly emphasised, such as various intelligent learning/tutoring systems, mobile devices, learning analytics, and augmented/virtual reality applications. Learning methods, materials and the time and places for learning were the aspects most frequently addressed. The objectives of the practices focused mainly on increasing learning effectiveness, followed by enhancing learners' motivation, engagement and satisfaction. The factors leading to successful personalised learning were identified from the articles reviewed, among which most factors were related to learners' characteristics, learning progress and technology. Research issues which need further investigation are recommended, particularly on the challenges arising from the adoption of emerging technologies, and the changing role of teachers in the trend towards student-centred personalised learning.

AB  - As an instructional material, 3D instructions afford people to learn procedural-manipulative tasks. Observing and emulating motions presented in 3D animations is important in learning contexts. This study examined the effects of visual cueing in an effort to identify the optimal way to present information in a 3D virtual environment. While previous studies have found that animations are more effective than static images for learning procedural-manipulative tasks, the transient nature of dynamic visualizations might create an unnecessary cognitive load on learners. To compensate strategically for the lack of permanency, this study suggests combining dynamic and static visualizations into one medium by adding transparent static images (visual cueing) to an animation. A between-subjects experiment was conducted to examine the effects of visual cueing on cognitive load and learning outcomes. The study found that the hybrid of dynamic and static visualizations was beneficial for reducing cognitive load, although it did not improve learning outcomes. The results suggest a design strategy for improving the effectiveness of 3D instructional animations. The findings are broadly applicable to numerous learning contexts, such as virtual reality storytelling, augmented reality games, and diverse gamification services.

AB  - Recent advances in information technology (IT) provided us with novel teaching solutions, with the potential of a new enhanced learning experience, that is, more adapted to the needs and preferences of the younger generations of psychiatric trainees. These tools include the use of online/virtual whiteboards, live surveys/polls, live quizzes, virtual classrooms, and virtual reality. In the present paper, we describe the implementation of modern technology in psychiatric training in Tunisia, a North-African middle-income country. We discuss the potential benefits arising from this implementation, and we report the challenges and difficulties. Overall, the implementation of these modern technology-based tools in psychiatric training has been successful, with a very few obstacles. It seems that the integration of these novel approaches is possible even in middle and low-income countries without much hassle. These tools can enhance trainees' participation, motivation, and engagement, thereby potentially improving learning outcomes. Most disadvantages are related to potential technical glitches, and are likely to improve as technology progresses. Teaching is the art of tailoring the educational tools to the learning objectives and to the learners' characteristics and preferences. To achieve optimal learning outcomes, it is often needed to use a mixture of different "modern" and "less modern" techniques.

AB  - The irruption of digital technologies in social contexts and their integration in education has led to new learning environments where the commu-nication, interaction and access to knowledge are an essential part of the educa-tional process. This paper shows a literature review and mapping of the most important technological tools used in the contexts where heritage teaching has been conducted in the last decade. For this aim developed a bibliometric analysis of scientific publications in high impact journals through selective searches in the specialized databases Scopus and Science Direct. The findings show trends in the educational practice approach regarding heritage, integrating emerging technol-ogies such as augmented reality, 3D modelling, artificial intelligence, QR coding and virtual reality that offer situated and immersive learning experiences on mo-bile apps and web-based platforms. From the studies analyzed in different con-texts, it is concluded that the integration of digital technologies in the teaching and heritage appropriation is a field that in recent years shows a clear increase, so that it is necessary to consider the potential of these tools in it's diffusion, teaching and preservation to strengthen existing work lines and open up possibil-ities to future studies.

AB  - Virtual reality technologies known since the 1990s have virtually disappeared. They have been replaced by their new editions characterised by a very faithful reproduction of details. The laboratory described in the article was created to study the intensity of various sensations experienced by a person in virtual worlds. A number of different scenarios have been developed that are designed to trigger specific reactions, to produce symptoms similar to those observed in arachnophobia, acrophobia or claustrophobia. The person examined can be equipped with a series of non-invasive sensors placed on the body in such a way that they do not interfere with immersion in VR. The laboratory instruments enable the acquisition and synchronisation of many signals. Body movement data is recorded by means of Kinect. Involuntary hand movements are measured with 5DT gloves. In addition, body temperature, ambient temperature and skin moisture are continuously monitored. Apart from recording the image from VR goggles, it is also possible to record the entire session on camera in 4K resolution in order to interpret facial expressions. The results are then analysed in detail and checked for patterns. The article describes both the test set-up itself as well as several test scenarios and presents the results of pilot studies.<bold> </bold>

AB  - Three-dimensional visualization of molecular simulations in virtual reality (VR) is an emerging teaching tool in chemical education. This work describes a VR application which can generate a 3D molecular dynamics (MD) simulation from arbitrary molecular structures and renders that MD simulation trajectory on a VR headset in real-time. This system uses the ZeroMQ (ZMQ) message passing framework for multisimulation to multiclient VR visualization of MD simulation. All MD simulations are done in the HOOMD-blue simulation engine, and the graphics for the VR are rendered in Unity3D. The key feature that sets this software apart from previous 3D viewer programs is the real-time simulation and thus the ability to manipulate thermodynamic variables like temperature on the fly. This allows viewers to build an intuitive understanding of the effects of thermodynamics state variables in a hands-on way. This application was used as a pedagogical tool with high school students, and the curriculum used, along with outcomes of the activity, has been presented here. This application can provide an interactive tool for teaching thermodynamics and statistical mechanics, and even as a diagnostic tool for MD simulations for research purposes.

AB  - Podcasting is used in higher education so various digital resources can be shared with students. This review aims to synthesise evidence on podcasting in nursing and midwifery education. PubMed, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Scopus and ERIC databases were searched using key terms. 242 articles were found and screened. Data extraction, quality assessment and data analysis, underpinned by a Social Media Learning Model, were conducted on relevant studies. Twenty-six studies were included in the review. Three themes emerged; 1) learning and other outcomes, 2) antecedents to learning, and 3) learning process. Students seemed to acquire new knowledge and skills by using podcasts and it also appeared to improve clinical confidence. The organisation of podcasting, digital literacy and e-Professionalism, the personal motivation of learners, and flexible access to the technology seemed to impact the delivery of this educational intervention. Mechanisms that appeared to affect the learning process were the speed of exchange, the type of social media user, the timeframe, quality of information, the functionality of podcasts and other learning activities. This review synthesised evidence on podcasting in nursing and midwifery education. The technology was seen as a positive learning tool but more robust research examining its efficacy in improving learning outcomes is needed.

AB  - The use of conversational agents in computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) has been identified as a useful tactic for motivational intervention. The purpose of the current study was to design and implement a conversational agent called a motivational online conversational agent (MOCA) that incorporated motivational interviewing (MI) and was based on an intelligent dialog engine to enhance learner engagement in CSCL. Additionally, the study empirically examined the effects of MOCA on promoting positive changes in collaborative learning engagement through multiturn conversation interventions. A prototype system was developed by combining MOCA and an immersive virtual world, and an effectiveness study was conducted with 40 volunteers. A series of multilevel growth models based on the framework of the hierarchical linear model was established through multiwave longitudinal data. The results indicated that the use of MOCA significantly improved student engagement scores (p < 0.001) and that female students performed better on collaborative tasks than male students (p < 0.05, t = 2.97). Additionally, time was an important predictor and significantly interacted with the MOCA-use condition. The study has implications for the design and assessment of conversational agents embodied in virtual reality.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has brought difficult times to anatomy educators and medical/dental students. Under normal circumstances, gross anatomy classes give students opportunities to touch and observe human bones and cadaveric tissues, thus enhancing their understanding; such morphology is difficult to learn from textbooks alone. As many studies have shown, three-dimensional (3D) technologies used in online lectures can serve as alternatives to real specimens for providing knowledge of anatomy. However, such technologies are often expensive. The goal of this study was to create 3D anatomy models for online lectures using a free cellphone app. Free application software (Qlone) was used to create 3D anatomical models. The extracranium and intracranium of adult skull, fetal skull, mandible, temporal bone, second cervical vertebra, and ilium were all scanned and exported to the computer in 3D format. A total of 53 anatomical structures were evaluated by nine observers. Although the 53 structures used in this study did not include all the structures that students need to learn, visibility was good/acceptable for most of the 53. The free and simple 3D scanning app used in this study could enable anatomy educators to provide better content to students during online lectures.

AB  - Simulation based learning has emerged as a new tool that potentially could replace and amplify the real-world experience in a fully interactive way. This learning technique can play a key role in the classroom setting to provide engineering students with the required knowledge and skills. In order to evaluate the possibility of using virtual bioprocess engineering laboratory as a tool in learning to mitigate practical dilemmas in chemical engineering curriculum, a virtual bioprocess engineering laboratory has been designed and developed at the University of Waikato. The virtual laboratory was made available to the third-year chemical engineering students enrolled in the biotechnology course. Participants were asked to attend both the physical and virtual laboratories and complete a range of questionnaires. It was found that by conducting the virtual bioprocess engineering laboratory, students gained a deeper understanding about fermentation principles, laboratory safety rules, experiment design and analysis of data. Based on the results, virtual reality bioprocess engineering laboratory can also provide a safe, affordable and timely experience to gain the required bioprocess engineering proficiency and skills. More than 90 % of students found the virtual lab to be an essential tool to undertake hands-on experiments effectively. (C) 2020 Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The aim of this study is to identify topics (knowledge and skills) from the dental curricula that would benefit from having a 3D learning resource using an exploratory sequential design method. The first phase targeted stakeholders from a Scottish dental school. Seven focus groups and three interviews disclosed 97 suitable topics for 3D technology development. These results were used to construct a survey that was sent to final year dental students, newly dental graduates and academics from three Scottish universities. The survey asked participants to rank each item based on the perceived benefit that a 3D learning resource would have for dental education. Results revealed that detailed anatomy of the temporomandibular joint, dental anaesthesiology, dental clinical skills techniques, dental occlusion and mandibular functioning were top priorities. Gender differences only appeared in relation to 'Extraction techniques: movements and force' (p < 0.05), this topic was considered to be more beneficial by females than by males. No statistical difference was found when comparing results of graduates with undergraduates. These results serve as a starting point when developing a new 3D technology tool for dental education, considering users demands and perceived needs has the potential to benefit dental students and dental education directly.

AB  - This article presents the results of a study that examined students' ability to retain what they have learned in an anatomy course after thirty days via using various learning tools for twenty minutes. Fifty-two second-year medical students were randomly assigned to three learning tools: text-only, three-dimension visualisation in a two-dimensional screen (3DM), or mixed reality (MR). An anatomy test lasting for twenty minutes measuring spatial and nominal knowledge was taken immediately after the learning intervention and another thirty days later. Psychometric tests were also used to measure participants' memory, reasoning and concentration abilities. Additionally, electroencephalogram data was captured to measure the participants' awakeness during the learning session. Results of this study showed that the MR group performed poorly in the nominal questions compared to the other groups; however, the MR group demonstrated higher retention in both the nominal and spatial type information for at least a month compared to the other groups. Furthermore, participants in the 3DM and MR groups reported increased engagement. The results of this study suggest that three-dimensional visualiser tools are likely to enhance learning in anatomy education. However, the study itself has several limitations; some include limited sample size and various threats to internal validity.

AB  - Ensuring the accessibility of education based on the development of online learning as one of the tasks of the global educational policy is acquiring key importance today. This task is complicated by different levels of economic development of countries and digital divide, problems of modernization of national education systems in the context of the spread of IT technologies. The development of education is closely related to technological advances (artificial intelligence, augmented and virtual reality, robotics), but such changes are not actively manifested in education due to its conservatism, and are also associated with the level of development of countries and access to new technologies for citizens. An analysis of investment activity in the education sector shows that investors are wary of financing the development of education and, in particular, online education, but trends over the past five years show a fourfold increase in total investment. The article concludes that: 1) despite the emergence of both universal and specialized educational online platforms, they cannot create an individual trajectory for acquiring knowledge and mastering competencies, as this can still be done on the basis of classical university education; 2) online platforms broadens the choice among the many offered educational programs and courses, however objectivity of this choice tends to be decreasing.

AB  - General Education (GE) module is a basic requirement for students who are studying undergraduate programmes in City University of Hong Kong (CityU). Several study areas are included in the GE curriculum design to achieve the all-round training objectives, although College-specified courses might be varied for different college or school. It is always a challenge for teaching staff to engage students in science and engineering GE module; particular VR activities are designed in supporting blended learning approach. The study survey was undertaken with 88 samples while the students finished both VR activities with a 5-point Likert scale, and the mean comparison on the "ease of use" study was conducted with a t-test. The acceptance level with high mean values is found with using VR activities to enhance students' learning experience. Also, there is no significant difference in the "ease of use" studies while comparing two types of VR contents. Both the VR contents using 360-degree production and 3D modelling production have their limitations, which are deficient interactive features and lack of real-world image projection. Moreover, the development of teaching pedagogies with virtual tours are discussed; production workflow, features, and limitations of these two VR content types are recorded for review and future enhancement.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of interactive online learning tools on college student learning using flow as the guiding perspective. Study 1 was conducted to test the effect of online interactivity manipulated by dynamic visual learning tools on student's flow experience, level of telepresence, actual performance on tests, and perceived values of such activities. Study 2 was designed to test the effect of personalizability of difficulty levels in the interactive online activity on students' learning experience. The results found that interactive online learning tools can facilitate student's active learning process by increasing attention, curiosity, and interest about the online activity and by reducing awareness of physical surroundings. In addition, the interactive activity significantly improved students' test scores. This study also found that personalized difficulty options available in the interactive online activity significantly increased students' perceived hedonic value (i.e., enjoyment) of and the level of satisfaction with the activity. The results emphasize the critical role of interactive visual learning tools in the online activities in improving students' flow experience and actual performance. Personalizability of task levels is also recommended in online learning activities to increase students' perceived hedonic value and satisfaction with such online activities.

AB  - Automatic Control, also called feedback control has been a field of engineering science since the 1950s. A very attractive feature of the field is its generality and its wide application in many engineering areas; however, this feature also generates certain teaching and learning experience related challenges. The curriculum is extremely theoretical, the students need to have a strong mathematical background and they need to be able to handle very abstract concepts. In the past, the theoretical aspects of the course were complemented with MATLAB/Simulink numerical simulations to assist the teaching and learning. Currently, both teaching methods and students learning outcomes are being reviewed in an attempt to develop a more integrated learning experience. The aims of these changes are to: (1) increase interaction between the lecturer and the students and between the students themselves using e-learning technologies and interactive windows, (2) to assist students struggling with abstraction by using not only numerical simulations, but also 3D simulations to start with, and augmented/virtual reality in the future, (3) to increase student engagement with the taught material by using physical demonstrators during lectures. The physical demonstrators will be also available for students to use in their own time, (4) to engage with control engineers working in industry in order to understand the state of the art/needs in the professional field.

AB  - Occasioned by the celebration of the 200 years since the outbreak of the Greek Revolution of 1821, Onassis Library, in collaboration with the Cartographic Heritage Archives of General State Archives of Greece and the Department of Geography of Harokopio University, designed a series of four digital workshops to motivate teenagers to bring to life one of the most emblematic maps of the so-called Greek Enlightenment during the eighteenth century and major item of the Greek cartographic heritage: Rigas Velestinlis Charta (map) of Greece (1796-1797). From January to March 2020, four school teams consisting of students 13-17 years old, approached in a creative way the map that inspired the Greek Revolution of 1821, transforming it into a computer game, a digital story, an augmented reality or a virtual reality application. By using innovative mixtures of history, geography, cartography, visual arts and information technology, they managed to expand their knowledge and skills by participating in an entertaining learning process. All participants acknowledged the pedagogical value of this innovative experience, which cultivated a positive attitude towards the learning procedure, enriching the lessons of history and geography, promoting the cartographic cultural heritage through new technology approaches and using valuable digital techniques and tools.

AB  - Current instructional tools for anatomy education are insufficient scaffolds for learning abstract visual concepts such as basic biomechanics. Diagrams, illustrations and even computer-generated models may be adequate for identification purposes, but are typically not effective when it comes to demonstrating dynamic functions. Evidence from educational concepts, such as the active learning principle in constructivism, indicate that current tools are ineffective due to a lack of opportunity for hands-on or interactive, learning. To address this, our interdisciplinary team designed an instructional model of the canine thoracic limb which is physical, kinetic and interactive. We hypothesised that the unique combination of these three crucial elements would enhance the student learning experience. In order to test this hypothesis, we asked 126 undergraduate students in a biomedical anatomy course to interact with the model. Students were then invited to complete a survey evaluating their experience using the thoracic limb model. Results from completed surveys showed that students perceived the model as easy to use and helpful with understanding basic biomechanical concepts. These results indicate that there is potential for the model to positively impact the students? learning. Future studies will include quantitative evaluation of student performance and cognitive impact in the biomedical anatomy course.

AB  - Since the arrival of the Internet in Spain in the 1990s, digital technologies have demonstrated their multitude and diversity of applications in various fields, including education. We use the concept of advanced technologies to refer to the latest technological developments within the field of digital technologies, including both software and hardware developments. In this paper, we review some relevant and interesting works related to this topic of advanced technologies. We have utilized an analytical review method and have carried out the selection of didactic experiences around four categories which we have considered of relevance: computation (robotics, computational thinking and artificial intelligence), extended reality (augmented reality and virtual reality), games (video games, serious games) and educational tools (LMS, apps). With these descriptors, we have searched educational experiences that can serve as examples of good educational practices with advanced technologies. The references, which we collect, may be of interest and use to researchers or to educational professionals who are searching specific information on these topics. The main conclusion we reach is that the bibliography is extensive, and this shows the interest that these themes generate within the scientific field. Furthermore, it shows the wide range of possibilities of application of these technologies, both in formal and non-formal contexts, as well as informal experiences.

AB  - Many accidents occur during construction and maintenance of facilities. Logically, decisions made during the design and planning of a project can influence workers' safety. The approach of considering safety in design and planning to control workplace hazards is called Prevention through Design (Pd)). Many fresh graduates from architecture, construction, and civil engineering programs do not learn about PtD. Hence, the organizations which hire these graduates have to train them in the area of PtD. In most university curricula, there is no room for a new course focused on PtD. Then non-traditional approaches such as computer games and simulations can be implemented to teach PtD in universities. Computer games are routinely considered as the most important and influential medium by today's college students. The present work aims to measure the effectiveness of computer games to train and educate students for safe design thinking. Therefore, three interventions-a computer-based serious game, a paper-based game (the paper version of the serious game) and a traditional lecture-were developed and implemented to measure their pedagogical value. The serious game was found to be more effective as compared to the lecture. The paper-based game failed to motivate the students to learn. This paper discusses the possible reasons for the success and failures of these pedagogical approaches.

AB  - Over the past year, defined by the COVID-19 pandemic, we have witnessed a boom in applying key emerging technologies in education. In such challenging situations, technology and education expanded their work together to strengthen and interactively impact the learning process in the online higher education context. From a pedagogical perspective, extended reality (XR) and artificial intelligence (AI) were accessible toolboxes to amplify an active and learner-centered teaching method. Whether and how such activities will continue in a post-COVID-19 situation remains unclear. In this systematic literature review, we document the application of XR and AI in online higher education settings and build up an accurate depiction of their influence after the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. A significant contribution of the thorough analysis conducted was the corroboration of the growing interest of these fast-emerging technologies and their impact on learner agency and outcomes, making online education more accessible, effective, engaging, collaborative, self-paced, and adapted to the diverse academic trajectories. The momentum brought about by the pandemic has served as an impulse for educators and universities to expand the use of these technologies progressively, meet new challenges, and shape the future of online higher education.

AB  - Aviation is an interdisciplinary subject that has influenced human development over the last century. Learning about aviation exposes students to principles of flight, language, earth science, aeronautical engineering, flight training and airmanship. In K-12 education, educators have started to encourage children to learn science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) subjects via aviation-themed activities to develop future scientists and engineers. This study investigated upper primary students' motivations to learn STEM via engaging in flight simulation experiences. The sample consisted of 345 10- to 13-year-old Hong Kong students from 8 primary schools. A modified version of the 31-item Science Motivation Questionnaire II (SMQ II) with four subscales with a focus on aviation was used. The relationships between intrinsic motivation, extrinsic motivation, self-efficacy and peer support across gender and performance were examined. The data obtained were analysed using factor analysis and a regression model. According to our model, students are most strongly motivated by peer support, followed by intrinsic motivation, and they are least motivated by self-efficacy. As expected, our results indicate that a gender gap exists in aviation-themed STEM learning. These findings can help educators to better understand students' perceptions of aviation science and further develop related learning activities.

AB  - Background: Virtual environments have brought the use of realistic training closer to many different fields of education. In medical education, several visualization methods for studying inside the human body have been introduced as a way to verify the structure of internal organs. However, these methods are insufficient for realistic training simulators because they do not provide photorealistic scenes or offer an intuitive perception to the user. In addition, they are used in limited environments within a classroom setting.
   Methods: We have developed a virtual dissection exploration system that provides realistic three-dimensional images and a virtual endoscopic experience. This system enables the user to manipulate a virtual camera through a human organ, using gesture-sensing technology. We can make a virtual dissection image of the human body using a virtual dissection simulator and then navigate inside an organ using a virtual endoscope. To improve the navigation performance during virtual endoscopy, our system warns the user about any potential collisions that may occur against the organ's wall by taking the virtual control sphere at the virtual camera position into consideration.
   Results: Experimental results show that our system efficiently provides high-quality anatomical visualization. We can simulate anatomic training using virtual dissection and endoscopic images.
   Conclusion: Our training simulator would be helpful in training medical students because it provides an immersive environment.

AB  - While virtual, augmented, and mixed reality technologies are being used for military medical training and beyond, these component technologies are oftentimes utilized in isolation. eXtended Reality (XR) combines these immersive form factors to support a continuum of virtual training capabilities to include full immersion, augmented overlays that provide multimodal cues to personalize instruction, and physical models to support embodiment and practice of psychomotor skills. When combined, XR technologies provide a multi-faceted training paradigm in which the whole is greater than the sum of the constituent capabilities in isolation. When XR applications are adaptive, and thus vary operational stressors, complexity, learner assistance, and fidelity as a function of trainee proficiency, substantial gains in training efficacy are expected. This paper describes a continuum of XR technologies and how they can be coupled with numerous adaptation strategies and supportive artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to realize personalized, competency-based training solutions that accelerate time to proficiency. Application of this training continuum is demonstrated through a Tactical Combat Casualty Care training use case. Such AI-enabled XR training solutions have the potential to support the military in meeting their growing training demands across military domains and applications, and to provide the right training at the right time.

AB  - We live in a society where physical and virtual reality are increasingly intertwined. The boundaries between the body and the imaginary gain new contours and definitions, affecting important and essential aspects, such as the power of participation and emancipation of the individual in the society in which he/she is inserted. The rapid pace of the technological and digital society makes it essential that both teachers and students know how to use different digital resources to create and deve- lop learning environments that lead not only to the acquisition of knowledge, but also to scenarios that promote the development of different learning skills. Recently, the emphasis given to the relevance of digital competence has resulted in the development of various initiatives in Europe aimed at promoting digital and media competence. In addition, evaluating media in a critical and conscious way, developing the skills necessary to participate in an active and informed way in society, is considered today a fundamental competence for an increasingly mediated society and also for an education that increasingly moves in a fluid way between formal and non-formal spaces. To this end, it is necessary to rethink the objectives and methodologies of education, based on a concept of literacy that is continuously evolving, related to the skills needed to read, understand and communicate.

AB  - The deployment of augmented reality (AR) has attracted educators' interest and introduced new opportunities in education. Additionally, the advancement of artificial intelligence has enabled educational researchers to apply innovative methods and techniques for the monitoring and evaluation of the teaching and learning process. The so-called learning analytics (LA) discipline emerged with the promise to revolutionize traditional instructional practices by introducing systematic and multidimensional ways to improve the effectiveness of the instructional process. However, the implementation of LA methods is usually associated with web-based platforms, which offer direct access to learners' data with minimal effort or adjustments. On the other hand, the complex nature of immersive technologies and the diverse instructional approaches which are utilized in different scientific domains have limited the opportunities for research and development in this direction. Within these research contexts, we present a conceptual framework that describes the elements of an LA process tailored to the information that can be gathered from the use of educational applications, and further provide an indicative case study for AR-supported educational interventions. The current work contributes by elucidating and concretizing the design elements of AR-supported applications and provides researchers and designers with guidelines on how to apply instructional strategies in (augmented) real-world projects.

AB  - In this study, the trends and developments of technology-enhanced adaptive/personalized learning have been studied by reviewing the related journal articles in the recent decade (i.e., from 2007 to 2017). To be specific, we investigated many research issues such as the parameters of adaptive/personalized learning, learning supports, learning outcomes, subjects, participants, hardware, and so on. Furthermore, this study reveals that personalized/adaptive learning has always been an attractive topic in this field, and personalized data sources, for example, students' preferences, learning achievements, profiles, and learning logs have become the main parameters for supporting personalized/adaptive learning. In addition, we found that the majority of the studies on personalized/adaptive learning still only supported traditional computers or devices, while only a few studies have been conducted on wearable devices, smartphones and tablet computers. In other words, personalized/adaptive learning has a significant number of potential applications on the above smart devices with the rapid development of artificial intelligence, virtual reality, cloud computing and wearable computing. Through the in-depth analysis of the trends and developments in the various dimensions of personalized/adaptive learning, the future research directions, issues and challenges are discussed in our paper.

AB  - Anatomy is one of the fundamental and core basic medical sciences in medical education. It forms the basis for physiology and subsequently pathophysiology to understand the aetiology of diseases, followed by the treatment in medical curricula. The traditional mechanism and gold standard for teaching anatomy in the medical curricula is cadaveric dissection in a small-group teaching environment. This type of teaching also develops compassion and empathy in training medical professionals. The onset of COVID-19 pandemic has limited the ability of faculty and students to function in this educational space as social/physical distancing guidelines, and the halting of cadaveric donation programmes has been implemented as safeguard measures against the transmission of the virus. Anatomists and other teaching staff within the discipline have been limited significantly to the use of technology-enhanced learning (TEL). TEL has been used in teaching environments prior and subsequent to the onset of COVID-19 to supplement cadaveric dissection, especially in medical programmes with limited cadaveric resources. While TEL is not interchangeable with cadaveric dissection, it appears to be a near and potentially medium-long-term solution to remote anatomy teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic. A blended hands-on approach with virtual reality three-dimensional experience can also be adopted in anatomy teaching during the neo-normal period.

AB  - This article explores the current and expected direction of education in reproduction at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine of Utrecht University. The current reproductive course in the Bachelor's programme is described. Based on the yearly routine course evaluation, changes have been started and continue to be implemented, and the educational ideas behind it are defined. Interactive e-learning modules that combine knowledge clips, animations, and quizzes have been developed. For the practical classes, e-modules with instructional videos have been paired to the written material. Using these new tools during self-study, students have to prepare for the necessary face-to-face classes that contain more in-depth discussions and practical training. In the second part, the author describes his expectations for further educational development. The growth of effective self-study using e-learning, besides traditional textbooks, before more in-depth face-to-face classes is likely to occur. With the growth of modern possibilities, such as the haptic technique and virtual reality, a better preparation in laboratory skills before practical training with animals is expected. In the author's opinion, despite all new learning methods and material, small group, face-to-face lectures, and practical classes with animals or animal material remain absolutely necessary. This article concludes with some lessons learned during the current adaptation of the course.

AB  - Introduction: India struggles the concerns of poor quality of medical education, incompetent medical workforces, and insignificant research contribution to the world.
   Aim: Teaching-learning methods form an integral part of any curriculum hence we aim to review the application of technology in teaching-learning methods at medical institutions across the world.
   Materials and Methods: An online search for articles and abstracts published from 2000 to 2020 on PubMed Central, Medline, Scopus, Google scholar using the MeSH terms like medical, education, innovative teaching, three dimensional, curriculum, etc., was conducted. A total of 49 articles were shortlisted by applying inclusion and exclusion criteria. A total of 38 articles were finally selected after thorough reading and were analysed and summarised.
   Results: Four themes emerged from this review: understanding learner characteristics; innovative newer techniques with the incorporation of advanced technology; cast models and plastination; and future trends for medical education. The more specific findings can be further divided into: online digital learning module; flip classroom; 3D printed models; 3D virtual reality based technology; simulation techniques; real patient learning practical's; medical student collaborative clinics; student driven undergraduate research committee; patient-family interactive programs; death and dying discussions and community-based service project.
   Conclusion: Amendment in the curriculum and selection of teaching-learning methods should be considered after understanding the student characteristics. Modern technology should be used rationally in teaching-learning methods thereby restricting its negative impact on the students.

AB  - The aim of the present systematic review was to evaluate the effectiveness of technology-enhanced learning (TEL) in the field of Endodontics to improve educational outcomes compared to traditional learning methods. Randomized controlled studies published in English were identified from two electronic databases (PubMed and Scopus) up to May 2018. Two authors independently performed study selection, data extraction and assessed the risk of bias (ROB). Any teaching method using TEL was considered as the intervention, and this was compared to traditional methods. The outcome measuring the effectiveness of learning activities was evaluated by Kirkpatrick's four-level training evaluation model. The four levels of training outcomes are as follows: Reaction, Learning, Behaviour and Results. A meta-analysis was performed to estimate the standardized mean difference (SMD) by the random effects model. In total, 13 studies were included in the systematic review. Only three studies were assessed as low' ROB. A meta-analysis could not be performed in the domains of Reaction and Behaviour. No significant difference was observed in knowledge gain (Learning domain) between TEL and traditional methods (SMD, 0.14 (95% CI -0.10 to 0.39) I-2=62.7%). Similarly, no difference was observed in performance (Behaviour domain). A variable response was found in attitude (Reaction domain). From the available evidence, it can be concluded that TEL is equally as effective as traditional learning methods.

AB  - This article discusses the adoption of the Problem Based Learning (PBL) and Project Based Learning (P2BL) approaches in the teaching/learning process of telecommunications. A computational environment was defined to combine these two approaches which focused on the teaching of courses that cover topics related to telecommunications systems. Newly graduated professionals face difficulties when entering the job market, as they have to deal with situations that are not experienced in the academic world. There is still a tendency to rely on traditional approaches for the teaching of telecommunications systems that have proved to be inefficient, as they are only concerned with content and not the applications that the student will require in the job market. The aim of this research is to investigate whether the adoption of PBL and P2BL in a computational environment can enhance student learning more effectively than the traditional teaching approach. This involved conducting an experiment in 7 undergraduate classes to compare the performance of the students that adopted PBL and P2BL with that of the students who were taught with the traditional approach. Data were collected on the grades obtained by the students in the courses and these were statistically analyzed. The results show that the adoption of PBL and P2BL led to the students achieving a 32% increase in performance. However, it was noted that the infrastructure of the institutions directly influences the way the approaches are adopted and, hence affects, the results.

AB  - Purpose Digital anatomy is a novel emerging discipline. Use of virtual reality brings a revolution in educational anatomy by improving retention and learning outcomes. Indeed, virtual dissection is a new learning tool for students and surgeons. Three-dimensional vectorial models of the human body can be created from anatomical slices obtained by lengthy series of cryosection from the visible human projects. The aim of this paper is to show how these mesh models could be embedded into an Acrobat(R) 3dpdf interface, to produce an easy-to-use fully interactive educational tool. Methods The learning of this method and its practical application were evaluated on a multicentric cohort of 86 people divided into 3 groups, according to the duration of their training (1, 2 or 3 days, respectively). Participants learned how to use the Mesh tool and how to model 3D structures from anatomical sections. At the end of the training, they were given a survey form. Participants were also asked to rate the training (Poor; Average; Good; Very Good; Excellent). Results Ninety four percent of the subjects rated the device as excellent and would continue to use digital anatomy in their practice. Conclusion This result is the Diva3d(R) virtual dissection table, a powerful educational tool for anatomists and students. It could also be the basis of future simulation tools for hand surgeons training.

AB  - Over the last years, the successful integration of virtual reality in distance education contexts has led to the development of various frameworks related to the virtual learning approaches. 3D virtual worlds are an integral part of the landscape of education and demonstrate novel learning possibilities that can open new directions in education. An important aspect of virtual worlds relates to the intelligent, embodied pedagogical agents that are employed to enhance the interaction with students and improve their overall learning experience. The proper design and integration of embodied pedagogical agents in virtual learning environments are highly desirable. Although virtual agents constitute a vital part of virtual environments, their exact impact needs are yet to be addressed and assessed. The aim of the present study is to thoroughly examine and deeply understand the effect that embodied pedagogical agents have on the learning experience of students as well as on their performance. We examine how students perceive the role of pedagogical agents as learning companions during specific game-based activities and the effect that their assistance has on students' learning. A concrete experimental study was conducted in AVARES, a 3D virtual world educational environment that teaches the domain of environmental engineering and energy generation. The results of the study point out that embodied pedagogical agents can improve students' learning experience, enhance their engagement with learning activities and, most of all, improve their knowledge construction and performance.

AB  - Purpose The present study aims to synthesize and conceptualize, through a systematic literature review (SLR), the current state of gamification knowledge in the tourism and hospitality (T&H) sector, providing a roadmap for future research recommendations for service research and practice. Design/methodology/approach The research is based on a systematic literature review and adopts a systematic quantitative approach to summarize existing evidence on gamification usage in the T&H sector, focusing on relevant service literature on gamification. The authors analyze 36 papers published between 2011 and 2019. Findings The authors synthesize existing knowledge into five themes describing gamification's role in T&H (Edutainment, Sustainable behavior, Engagement factors, Service provider-generated content and User-generated reviews). Then, a cross-analysis of the five themes reveals the pivotal elements (affordances, behavioral and psychological outcomes, and benefits) generated by gamification mechanics in T&H, simultaneously highlighting potential implications and relevant insights for service literature. The review identifies critical issues affecting gamification research and provides a future research agenda, considering opportunities for T&H and service research. Originality/value The study provides the first SLR investigating gamification in T&H. The findings present potential implications and relevant insights for T&H contributing to the construction of a more holistic understanding of gamification adoption in service research.

AB  - Although a great deal of research has evidenced the effects of proper instructional design on multimedia learning, most has focused on the cognitive aspects of learning, with little concern about the role of affective-motivational states in multimedia learning. In this study, an AR game-based learning method was designed via integrating AR technology and a digital game for assisting students' learning, and for probing the factors of metacognitive and motivational factors of multimedia learning. A context-aware mobile learning system with reflection prompts was developed based on the implemented approach. Furthermore, a 2 x 2 experiment was conducted to identify the impacts of the implemented approach on elementary school science learning. Four groups learned with different media mechanisms (i.e., AR or Non-AR) and gaming mechanisms (i.e., Game or Non-game) during an elementary school field trip. The research results displayed that interaction between the AR and game approaches did not exist, and both significantly promoted the students' learning motivation; however, only the game approach significantly improved the students' learning achievements and flow states. This study evidenced the significance of flow state in a reflective context in multimedia learning. Such a result also stresses that digital games play an important role in promoting affective-motivational states in multimedia learning.

TI  - Deep oceanic submarine fieldwork with undergraduate students: an immersive experience with the Minerve software
T2  - SOLID EARTH
LA  - English
KW  - NORMAL-FAULT
AB  - We present the content and scripting of an active tectonic lab session conceived for third-year undergraduate students studying Earth sciences at Observatoire des Sciences de l'Univers in Lyon. This session is based on a research project conducted on the submarine Roseau active fault in the Lesser Antilles. The fault morphology is particularly interesting to map as this structure in the deep ocean is preserved from weathering. Thus, high-resolution models computed from remotely operated vehicle (ROV) videos provide exceptional educational material to link fault morphology and coseismic displacement. This class includes mapping exercises on geographical information systems and virtual fieldwork to provide basic understanding of active tectonics and active fault morphology in particular. The work has been conducted either in a full remote configuration via 3D online models or in virtual reality (VR) in a dedicated room using the Minerve software. During the VR sessions, students were either alone in the VR environment or participated as a group that included the instructor (physically in the classroom or remotely from another location), which is to our knowledge one of the first attempts of this kind in France. We discuss the efficiency of virtual fieldwork using VR based on feedback from teachers and students. We conclude that VR is a promising tool to learn observational skills in Earth sciences, subject to certain improvements that should be possible in the years to come.

AB  - This paper presents the findings of a study of Game-Based Learning (GBL) practitioners (N=12). The practitioners, who were a mix of academics, researchers and industry practitioners with experience of GBL research and / or implementation, were asked open questions in a survey about the effectiveness of GBL, the benefits that virtual reality (VR) bring to GBL, how the use of learning analytics dashboards (LADs) can help learner and educator, the mapping of learner interactions to taxonomies of learning, and whether universal design should be embedded at the heart of GBL. The questions also addressed the process by which GBL solutions are developed, with a focus on iterative prototyping and how GBL analytics can assist in the formative evaluation of a GBL solution when combined (triangulated) with other approaches (such as observations of learners playing a GBL solution). To assist the respondents, a case study was presented in the form of a game play video (of a VR-based GBL solution that teaches graph theory) with commentary by the GBL developer along with screenshots of learning analytics visualizations from a study of learners (N=20) carried out by the author.
   A thematic analysis was carried out on the responses. On a question by question basis, meaning units were identified and categorized, and the categories were organised into themes. This led to several findings per question. The findings include: GBL is effective, but must be well designed; VR is an exciting, largely unexplored medium with many positive pedagogical benefits, but it has disadvantages such as cost and inaccessibility; LADs assist learners to be more autonomous and help with their executive functions, but they need to be carefully designed with actionable information and need to use visual aids to help comprehension; mapping learner interactions to a taxonomy (for the purpose of visualization) can support learners' executive functions, such as assessing performance and progress, and setting goals - the gathering of learner interaction data has potential for automating the prediction of learner performance, which could lead to earlier intervention; an iterative approach to GBL development allows for greater inclusion of stakeholders, continuous improvement and more complex solutions - this agile approach in GBL development is under way and following the lead of other industries; using visualizations as part of formative evaluation can identify issues of usability, flow and balance, as well as measuring effectiveness; the practitioners agreed that universal design should be embedded at the heart of any model for GBL design and development, but were largely unaware of specific frameworks for universal design in education, such as the Universal Design for Learning (UDL) framework; when evaluating GBL solutions, a mixed methods approach was seen as best practice with triangulation then becoming possible to identify more complex issues.
   The findings of the practitioner study will be of interest to all designers and developers of GBL solutions. They provide guidance on many aspects of modern GBL, such as the benefits of VR, the use of agile development processes, the integration of learning analytics, and mixed methods evaluation that allows for triangulation of findings from multiple datasets.

AB  - Embodiment is particularly relevant for learning anatomy as the knowledge to be acquired is related to the body itself. Several tools using three-dimensional (3D) anatomical structures and avatars (e.g. augmented reality; virtual reality; immersive anatomy; 3D animations) were developed to enrich students' experience by including gestures and body movements into learning anatomy. We developed a new interactive 3D tool that allows personal body experience and enhances spatial representation of musculoskeletal functional anatomy. Students can analyze and recreate a series of movements in real-time 3D interactive settings. This paper shows our research and development approach. Following the development of our anatomy tool, we conducted a pilot and one experiment. The pilot study aimed at evaluating users' experience (UX) of our first prototype. Experiment I aimed at evaluating the UX of the second version of the tool two times in a pretest-training-posttest design. Students' spatial and motor imagery abilities as well as anatomy examination results were also collected. Our results provided evidence of UX enhancement. Accordingly students appreciated mainly the tool's hedonic (enjoyment) qualities. Overall, significant interactions were observed between students' UX, anatomy scores and motor imagery abilities. Finally, students' mental rotation ability predicted the increase of anatomy score. Cognitive sub-processes underlying functional human anatomy learning as well as students' identification through the avatar are discussed.

AB  - Background/purpose: Online learning has been utilized in the world to continue educational activities in dentistry, which was severely affected by the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The purpose of this study was aimed to evaluate the effect of online learning during the pandemic of COVID-19 in different dental schools of different countries in Asia by the questionnaire survey. Materials and methods: Mantel-Haenszel chi-square tests were used to analyze the difference between dental schools with and without shutdown. A questionnaire-based online survey was used to evaluate the online learning effect on undergraduate students in 13 dental schools of 7 Asia countries and regions. Results: For the question that blended learning class has better learning efficiency, the agreement rate was significantly higher in the students (80.3%) from the dental schools that did not suspend face-to-face education activities than in the students (50.3%) from the dental school that was shut down. Conclusion: Within the limitation of this study, it is concluded that a combination of physical and online classes in terms of blended learning courses will be the future trend for dental education.

AB  - Virtual reality has taken the world by storm over the past decade where learners are allowed to gain experiences that are not possible with ordinary teaching methods. The interactive technological devices such as GeoGebra have made Euclidean geometry easy to understand by learners. The current study aimed to investigate the use of technology in the teaching of Grade 12 Euclidean geometry. This study used a four-dimensional model for teaching with technology in the investigation. All responses were averaged and normalised to produce an index for the measurement of the effective technology use in teaching of Euclidean geometry in Grade 12. The learning style of students contributes significantly to the use of technology in classes, particularly the audio-visual learning style. Bloemfontein showed a high number of learners ready to be taught through technology. However, this is in opposition to the teachers in terms of their age groups and enthusiasm to use technology. In Botshabelo and Thaba Nchu areas that were previously resource-disadvantaged, the current government has ensured that technological teaching resources are available where unfortunately their usage is not satisfactory, ranging from 'maybe used' to 'less use of technology' in teaching of Euclidean geometry in classroom. The authorities are therefore advised to hold technology workshops for senior teachers, reduce class sizes and tighten security in schools to avoid connecting and disconnecting of technological devices from one classroom to another to avoid wastage of teaching time.

AB  - PurposeAs the amount of curricular material required of medical students increases, less time is available for anatomy; thus, methods to teach anatomy more efficiently and effectively are necessary. In this randomized controlled trial, we looked at the effectiveness of a mixed reality (MR) device to teach musculoskeletal anatomy to medical students compared with traditional cadaveric dissection.MethodParticipating students were divided into three cohorts. Cohort 1 first studied upper limb anatomy in MR followed by lower limb anatomy through cadaveric dissection. Cohort 2 studied upper limb anatomy with cadaveric dissection followed by lower limb anatomy in MR. After the six sessions, a third cohort of 33 students who never received any teaching in MR was recruited to participate in the final practical exams as a control group. All 64 students completed two practical exams with equivalent content, one in the cadaver lab and one using MR.ResultsThe average scores were 73.8% + 12.3 on the cadaver exam and 74.2% + 13.0 in MR. There is no statistical difference between these scores (p > 0.05). A correlation was found between the MR practical exam and cadaver practical exam scores (r = 0.74, p < 0.01) across all students.ConclusionsTo our knowledge, this study marks the first time that MR was compared with traditional anatomy learning modalities in a multi-session, group course. Our results clearly indicate that medical students, regardless of the study modality, performed similarly on the MR and the cadaver practical exams.

AB  - Field trips are steadily declining due to limited funding, time constraints, safety concerns, and other logistical issues. Many schools are resorting to a virtual field trip (VFT), especially when education is disrupted due to public health concerns, natural disasters, or other unforeseen significant events. Virtual reality as a common form of VFT is likely not an option for many schools due to cost and other barriers. The purpose of our study was to explore the potential of going in a VFT using 360-degree (360 degrees) videos as an alternative to a physical field trip in primary education. We recruited third-grade pupils (aged 8-9) from two private elementary schools to experience VFTs using 360 degrees videos (360V) and regular videos (REGV). Using a switching-replications experimental design, we compared their content recall (assessment tests) and VFT experience (attitude, perceived usefulness, involvement, inquiry, video engagement, and virtual guide) across four-time points. Our results show that the increase in content recall scores of 360V groups after VFTs was consistently higher compared to REGV groups at all time points, although it was only significant in one quarter. We also found pupils' video engagement, involvement, and attitude as significant factors in their VFT experience. These results call attention to a possible implementation of VFTs and continue the long-standing tradition that has been acknowledged as a student-centered, interactive instructional method.

AB  - The use of educational robotics for programming education has been shown to be effective in fostering students' computational thinking (CT) skills. However, physical educational robots are expensive, which may limit their wide use in the classroom. This study used augmented reality technology to develop a virtual educational robotic system (AR Bot for short), which offers 3D visual learning feedback to strengthen spatial ability, as well as delayed feedback and auto scoring feedback to promote students' deeper CT processes. To examine the impact of AR Bot on programming learning, this study used a quasi-experimental design to compare an experimental group of 41 first-year university students who used AR Bot and a control group of 34 first year university students who used Scratch. We assessed the impact of the two CT tools on students' internal learning processes (enjoyment of learning), CT skills (problem decomposition, algorithm design, and algorithm efficiency skills), and academic achievement. The results showed that students who used AR Bot had higher enjoyment of learning, algorithm design skills, and algorithm efficiency skills but not higher problem decomposition skills and academic achievement than students who used Scratch. Enjoyment of learning led to higher problem decomposition, algorithm design, and algorithm efficiency skills but not academic achievement. Problem decomposition and algorithm design skills, but not algorithm efficiency skills, led to academic achievement. The theoretical and practical implications of the proposed tool and other CT tools in programming education are discussed.

AB  - Augmented/virtual realities (ARs/VRs) promise to revolutionize STEM education. However, most easy-to-use tools are limited to static visualizations, which limits the approachable content, whereas more interactive and dynamic alternatives require costly hardware, preventing large-scale use and evaluation of pedagogical effects. Here, we introduce https://MoleculARweb.epfl.ch, a free, open-source web site with interactive AR webpage-based apps that work out-of-the-box in laptops, tablets, and smartphones, where students and teachers can naturally handle virtual objects to explore molecular structure, reactivity, dynamics, and interactions, covering topics from inorganic, organic, and biological chemistry. With these web apps, teachers and science communicators can develop interactive material for their lessons and hands-on activities for their students and target public, in person or online, as we exemplify. Thousands of accesses to moleculARweb attest to the ease of use; teacher feedback attests to the utility in online teaching and homework during a pandemic; and in-class plus online surveys show that users find AR engaging and useful for teaching and learning chemistry. These observations support the potential of AR in future education and show the large impact that modern web technologies have in democratizing access to digital learning tools, providing the possibility to mass-test the pedagogical effect of these technologies in STEM education.

AB  - Anatomical sciences curricula have been under constant reform over the years, with many countries having to reduce course hours while trying to preserve laboratory time. In Mexico, schools have historically been autonomous and unregulated, and data regarding structure and methods are still lacking. A national survey was sent by the Mexican Society of Anatomy to 110 anatomical sciences educators. The questionnaire consisted of 50 items (open and multiple choice) for gross anatomy, microscopic anatomy, neuroanatomy, and embryology courses in medical schools across Mexico. A clinical approach was the most common course approach in all disciplines. Contact course hours and laboratory hours were higher in Mexican anatomy education compared to other countries, with the highest reported contact hours for embryology (133.4 +/- 44.1) and histology (125 +/- 33.2). There were similar contact hours to other countries for gross anatomy (228.5 +/- 60.5). Neuroanatomy course hours (43.9 +/- 13.1) were less than reported by the United States and similar to Saudi Arabia and higher than the United Kingdom. Dissection and microscopy with histological slides predominate as the most common laboratory activities. Traditional methods prevail in most of the courses in Mexico and only a few educators have implemented innovative and technological tools. Implementation of new methods, approaches, and curricular changes are needed to enhance anatomical sciences education in Mexico.

AB  - The article describes physics projects created by students as future physics teachers to organize classes on the educational platform of the Children's University. The study was aimed at examining the performance of physics students through physics projects. The advantages of the Labster 3D virtual reality learning environment for motivating students to study physics are also considered. Generally, the results of the study showed an increase in interest among primary school students in STEM education and science. The study involved children from 10 to 12 years old in the amount of 250 schoolchildren in the city of Kokshetau (Kazakhstan). The article used methods such as mixed methods, questionnaires, and semi-structured interviews for children. The Likert scale questions allowed the analysis using descriptive statistics. Open-ended questions and data from the interviews were classified using content analysis and analytically interpreted through the theory of the development of cognitive interest in children. Children were provided by links to short 10-minute educational videos posted on Youtube video hosting called FIZMAT KSU While they were working remotely. During distance learning, children used different forms of virtual laboratory work. The results and conclusions of the study revealed the followings: visiting the Children's University increases children's interest in STEM - education and science, as well as the participation of future physics teachers in the activities of the Children's University forms the skills of organizing informal forms of work with children.

AB  - Despite an increase in the use of technology in undergraduate anatomy education, and the rising popularity of online anatomy courses at community colleges in the United States, there have been no reports on the efficacy of augmented reality on anatomy education in this population. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that augmented reality is an effective and engaging tool for learning anatomy in community college students. Participants recruited from Cuyahoga Community College (Cleveland, OH) studied skull anatomy using either traditional tools (i.e., textbook and plastic skull model) or an augmented reality head-mounted display with an interactive virtual skull application. Comparison of knowledge before and following the study period revealed that augmented reality was an effective tool for learning skull anatomy: pre-quiz = 32.7% (+/- 25.2); mean (+/- SD), post-quiz = 61.8% (+/- 19.5); n = 15; t((28))= 3.53;P = 0.001. The traditional tools were equally effective: pre-quiz = 44.9 % (+/- 18.6), post-quiz = 67.9 % (+/- 17.3); n = 17; t((32))= 3.73;P = 0.0007. Students rated the augmented reality device as 9.6 (+/- 1.0); mean (+/- SD) when asked if it fit the statement "fun to use" on a semantic differential scale from 1 (poor) to 10 (excellent). In conclusion, this study found that augmented reality is an effective and engaging tool for the instruction of skull anatomy at a community college.

AB  - Differentiating from the digital immigrants, who speak a "language" specific to the pre-digital era, the native digitals come to the fore by their own identity. Being built according to the specificity of the current society, it is marked by the influences of modern technology. In the field of education, e-learning covers a set of on-line and off-line applications and processes, which include a series of educational platforms and ways of learning based on web, CAI, virtual class, multimedia, etc. Compared to the other theories of learning, the cognitive theory of multimedia learning encourages the student to build a series of coherent mental connections, starting from multimedia material. The goal of this research is to make a comparative analysis between traditional education and e-learning. Starting from the features of virtual reality, we have focused on designing a sequence of training able to combine both the classical and modern approaches - based on the efficiency of the new educational technology. Being of an ameliorative type, our research starts from the premise that the educational process in the e-learning context is just as effective as the traditional one. It requires, however, a change in the pedagogical style and an up-dating of the way in which the training is being designed and done. Some forms of online learning (on-line and in the classroom) are likely to become the norm, because the students will choose one or several online courses to complete their training.

AB  - Objective: The present study compares the effectiveness of a standardized peer-to-peer role play (RP) and a virtual client-trainer (VC-T) in training graduate-level students in the development of interviewing and clinical skills related to working with the military population. The study examines each training modality in six areas: (a) self-efficacy, (b) initial engagement, (c) recognizing and responding to symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder, (d) recognizing and responding to symptoms of suicide, (e) military cultural competence, and (f) overall competence. Method: A quasi-experimental nonequivalent groups study design was used. The sample comprised students enrolled in a graduate-level program (RP = 61; VC-T = 75). Participants completed pretest measures, attended training, and completed posttest measures. Results: Broadly, the findings revealed that RP and the VC-T are equally effective in increasing trainees' self-efficacy, recognition and response to posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms, recognition and response to suicide symptoms, military cultural competence, and overall competence. These results suggest that regardless of training modality, trainees demonstrated increased clinical skills and competencies needed for working with the military population. Conclusions: The results suggest that both RP and the VC-T are equally effective, which opens the possibilities of implementing the VC-T as a training tool that has greater reach compared with RP. As more graduate programs offer an online version of their traditional on-ground coursework, the VC-T is an opportunity to have 1 training platform for both on-ground and online students.

AB  - Cognitive load theory has been a major influence for the field of educational psychology. One of the main guidelines of the theory is that extraneous cognitive load should be reduced to leave sufficient cognitive resources for the actual learning to take place. In recent years, research regarding various design factors, in particular from the field of digital and online learning, have challenged this assumption. Interactive learning media, immersion, disfluency, realism, and redundant elements constitute five major challenges, since these design factors have been shown to induce task-irrelevant cognitive load, i.e., extraneous load, while still promoting motivation and learning. However, currently there is no unified approach to integrate such effects into cognitive load theory. By including aspects of constructive alignment, an approach aimed at fostering deep forms of learning in order to achieve specific learning outcomes, we devise a strategy to balance cognitive load in digital learning. Most importantly, we suggest considering both the positive and negative effects on cognitive load that certain design factors of digital learning can cause. In addition, a number of research results highlight that some types of positive effects of digital learning can only be detected using a suitable assessment method. This strategy of aligning cognitive load with desired learning outcomes will be useful for formulating theory-guided and empirically testable hypotheses, but can be particularly helpful for practitioners to embrace emerging technologies while minimizing potential extraneous drawbacks.

AB  - OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this article is to compare the effectiveness of practical radiology learning by medical students in a 3D virtual world versus the real world.
   SUBJECTS AND METHODS. Two hundred fifteen 3rd-year medical students were randomized into two groups to attend the same workshop on abdominal radiography interpretation in a virtual world classroom (VW group) and in real life (RL group). Pre- and post-training knowledge tests consisting of 12 multiple choice questions were performed at the beginning of the workshop and 2 months later.
   RESULTS. Fifty-four of 107 and five of 108 students refused to attend their respective group, resulting in the participation of 53 students (VW group) and 103 students (RL group) in this study. No significant differences were found between groups in the tests taken before (VW group, mean [+/- SD], 4.5 +/- 1.8 points; RL group, 4.0 +/- 1.3 points) and after (VW group, 6.2 +/- 1.2; RL group, 6.0 +/- 1.7 points) training.
   CONCLUSION. Radiology education in a 3D virtual classroom fosters participatory learning and results in similar acquisition of interpretive skills as a traditional face-to-face classroom. Virtual worlds allow the performance of online activities to learn interpretive skills with guaranteed success in learning similar to that of conventional activities. Additionally, the relative lack of identity in the virtual workshops makes students less afraid to speak and more participatory.

AB  - COVID-19-related quarantine measures resulted in a significant increase of interest in online collaboration tools. This includes virtual reality (VR) or, in more general term, extended reality (XR) solutions. Shared XR allows for activities such as presentations, training of personnel or therapy to take place in a virtual space instead of a real one. To make online XR as accessible as possible, a significant effort has been put into the development of solutions that can run directly in web browsers. One of the most recognized solutions is the A-Frame software framework, created by Mozilla VR team and supporting most of the contemporary XR hardware. In addition, an extension called Networked-Aframe allows multiple users to share virtual environments, created using A-Frame, in real time. In this article, we introduce and experimentally evaluate three components that extend the functionality of A-Frame and Networked-Aframe. The first one extends Networked-Aframe with the ability to monitor and control users in a shared virtual scene. The second one implements six degrees of freedom motion tracking for smartphone-based VR headsets. The third one brings hand gesture support to the Microsoft HoloLens holographic computer. The evaluation was performed in a dedicated local network environment with 5, 10, 15 and 20 client computers. Each computer represented one user in a shared virtual scene. Since the experiments were carried out with and without the introduced components, the results presented here can also be regarded as a performance evaluation of A-Frame and Networked-Aframe themselves.

AB  - Students experience challenges when understanding visual information in multimedia learning. Specifically, immersive multimedia environments, such as virtual reality increase the likelihood that students undergo distractions in which information seeking during system-paced instruction occurred. Although previous studies have reviewed various cue designs to yield students' higher attention, skepticism still exists regarding which ways cue designs can support their learning comprehension in video instruction. For this study, we sampled a total of 64 undergraduates in a university. Using video instruction performed by an animated pedagogical agent (APA), this study examined the effect of social (i.e., an APA's conversational gestures) and cognitive (i.e., visual cue) cues on students' learning comprehension and eye-gaze data within types of visual information (text and pictorial). Also, this study investigated how both cues promoted students' cognitive load overall. Specific to text information processing, the results of the study confirmed that the negative prime effect of social cues undermined students' learning comprehension and increased their cognitive load, whereas cognitive cues appeared to be supportive in video instruction. Also, this study found that students' different visual-attention patterns appeared in pictorial information processing. In terms of pictorial information processing, the study finding implies that whereas social cues caused visual distractions and lowered learning comprehension, cognitive cues as visual cues helped learners to integrate pictorial information via visuospatial clues. Conclusively, we reported several design implications derived from the study findings.

AB  - Anatomy forms the basis of clinical examination, surgery and radiology and it is therefore essential that a fundamental understanding of the key concepts, structures and their relationships is gained by medical and healthcare students during their undergraduate training. Anatomy involves the study of three dimensional entities relating to the human body itself and its constituent structures. In our experience, the appreciation of 3D concepts is one of the most demanding areas for medical student learning of anatomy (ben Awadh et al. 2018, unpublished observations). The ability to interpret 3D anatomical features in 2D cross-sectional clinical images can be troublesome, while the dynamic nature of embryological development is a further challenge.
   The aim of introducing technology enhanced-learning (TEL) approaches into our practice is with a view to enhancing undergraduate medical student learning of clinically relevant anatomy. Here we will explore the importance of visualisation and visual learning in anatomy as a scholarly basis for the integration for TEL approaches. We will then describe examples of visualisation technologies that are currently being implemented within the School of Medical Education at Newcastle University based on a research informed understanding of how students learn anatomy. We will consider the available evidence that supports best practice, identify limitations where they arise, and discuss how these visual 3D learning technologies can be effectively utilised as adjuncts and self-directed resources to supplement more established approaches to undergraduate anatomy education.

AB  - Augmented, mixed, and virtual reality applications and content have surged into the higher education arena, thereby allowing institutions to engage in research and development projects to better understand their efficacy within curricula. However, despite the increasing interest, there remains a lack of robust empirical evidence to justify the mainstream acceptance of this approach as an effective and efficient learning tool. In this study, the impact of a mixed reality application focused on long spinal cord sensory and motor pathways is explored in comparison to an existing resource already embedded within an active curriculum (e.g., anatomy drawing screencasts). To assess the changes in learner gain, a quasi-randomized control trial with a pre- and post-test methodology was used on a cohort of Year 2 medical students, with both the absolute and normalized gain calculated. Similar patterns of learner gain were observed between the two groups; only the multiple-choice questionnaires were shown to be answered significantly higher with the screencast group. This study adds important empirical data to the emerging field of immersive technologies and the specific impact on short-term knowledge gain for neuroanatomy teaching, specifically that of long sensory and motor pathways. Despite the limitations of the study, it provides important additional data to the field and intends to support colleagues across the education landscape in making evidence-informed decisions about the value of including such resources into their curricula.

AB  - Neuroanatomy is difficult for psychology students because of spatial visualization and the relationship among brain structures. Some technologies have been implemented to facilitate the learning of anatomy using three-dimensional (3D) visualization of anatomy contents. Augmented reality (AR) is a promising technology in this field. A mobile AR application to provide the visualization of morphological and functional information of the brain was developed. A sample of 67 students of neuropsychology completed tests for visuospatial ability, anatomical knowledge, learning goals, and experience with technologies. Subsequently, they performed a learning activity using one of the visualization methods considered: a 3D method using the AR application and a two-dimensional (2D) method using a textbook to color, followed by questions concerning their satisfaction and knowledge. After using the alternative method, the students expressed their preference. The two methods improved knowledge equally, but the 3D method obtained higher satisfaction scores and was more preferred by students. The 3D method was also more preferred by the students who used this method during the activity. After controlling for the method used in the activity, associations were found between the preference of the 3D method because of its usability and experience with technologies. These results found that the AR application was highly valued by students to learn and was as effective as the textbook for this purpose.

AB  - The study of human anatomy has transcended with various resources and scenarios. The objective was to compare published studies on traditional laboratory practices with new technologies for the study of the human body in medical students. A systematic review and meta-analysis were carried out. Four reviewers carried out a systematic and exhaustive search of the literature, based on the location and selection of 54 primary studies published in ten databases, three reviewers evaluated the methodological quality of 33 studies, with checklists for the critical evaluation of internal validity, according to type of study. The fourth blinded reviewer, calculated degree of agreement between reviewers with Kappa de Fleiss and assessed risk of bias, sensitivity, heterogeneity and combined analysis using RevMan 5.4. A qualitative systematic review and combination by statistical methods of the results were obtained with meta-analysis of seven primary studies, with a sample of 465 participants, 260 exposed to traditional laboratories and 205 to new technologies. Finding satisfaction with the process and positive results of learning, understanding and application, with initial favorability to traditional practices not significant when assessing the confidence intervals. Thus, the contrast between methods for these practices revealed outcomes related to physical-emotional reactions, focus on the academic performance construct and with the learning processes. Concluding that laboratories with new technologies for the study of anatomy do not prerogatively impact students, given their favorable experience with traditional laboratories, and can be used as a useful complementary strategy.

AB  - Effectiveness, efficiency, scalability, autonomy, engagement, flexibility, adaptiveness, personalization, conversationality, reflectiveness, innovation, and self-organization are some of the fundamental features of smart environments. Smart environments are considered a good learning practice for formal and informal education; however, it is important to point out the pedagogical approaches on which they are based. Smart learning environments (SLEs) underline the flexibility of eclectic pedagogy that places students at the center of any educational process and takes into account the diversity in classrooms. Thus, SLEs incorporate pedagogical principles derived from (1) traditional learning theories, e.g., behaviorism and constructivism, (2) contemporary pedagogical philosophy, e.g., differentiated teaching and universal design for learning, (3) theories that provide specific instructions for educational design, e.g., cognitive theory of multimedia learning and gamification of learning. The innovative concept of transmedia learning is an eclectic pedagogical approach, which in addition to learning principles, blends all available media so far. WUIM is a transmedia program for training independent living skills aimed primarily at children with learning disabilities, which emerged from the composition of pedagogical theories, traditional educational materials and cutting-edge technologies such as augmented and virtual reality, and art-based production methodologies. This paper outlines the development of WUIM, from the prototyping presented at the 4th International Conference in Creative Writing (2019) to the Alpha and Beta stages, including user and expert evaluations.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of mixed reality models in anatomy teaching and learning at Kirkpatrick's level I, using Peer Assisted Learning approach. This study was based on a single group, post-test study design and was carried out at three affiliated medical schools of Khyber Medical University, Peshawar, over four months. A total of 97 first-and second-year medical students from three medical schools were enrolled. All students received a basic introduction to the use of Hololens (Microsoft), the mixed-reality simulator-based course on the anatomy of the heart and liver via peer-assisted learning (PAL) method. Student satisfaction was evaluated at Kirkpatrick Level I of program evaluation using a validated and structured PAL questionnaire.Most students agreed or strongly agreed to the effectiveness of questions (mean +/- SD 4.3 +/- 0.2, percentage 86 +/- 4.4%). There was no difference between the satisfaction scores of male and female students (p=0.34), whereas a slight difference was seen between 2nd-and 1st-year students' satisfaction scores (88% versus 85%, p=0.03). There was also a statistically significant difference of perceptions between different medical schools' students' scores (p=.000). Students appear to be satisfied with the use of the mixed reality model for learning anatomy. A randomized trial to directly compare the satisfaction levels between traditional methods and mixed-reality model may be conducted and the effects of mixed-reality models on learning should be assessed.

AB  - BackgroundBasic surgical skills teaching is often delivered with didactic audio-visual content, and new digital technologies may allow more engaging and effective ways of teaching to be developed. The Microsoft HoloLens 2 (HL2) is a multi-functional mixed reality headset. This prospective feasibility study sought to assess the device as a tool for enhancing technical surgical skills training.MethodsA prospective randomised feasibility study was conducted. 36 novice medical students were trained to perform a basic arteriotomy and closure using a synthetic model. Participants were randomised to receive a structured surgical skills tutorial via a bespoke mixed reality HL2 tutorial (n = 18), or via a standard video-based tutorial (n = 18). Proficiency scores were assessed by blinded examiners using a validated objective scoring system and participant feedback collected.ResultsThe HL2 group showed significantly greater improvement in overall technical proficiency compared to the video group (10.1 vs. 6.89, p = 0.0076), and a greater consistency in skill progression with a significantly narrower range of scores (SD 2.48 vs. 4.03, p = 0.026). Participant feedback showed the HL2 technology to be more interactive and engaging with minimal device related problems experienced.ConclusionsThis study has demonstrated that mixed reality technology may provide a higher quality educational experience, improved skill progression and greater consistency in learning when compared to traditional teaching methodologies for basic surgical skills. Further work is required to refine, translate, and evaluate the scalability and applicability of the technology across a broad range of skills-based disciplines.

AB  - Supplemental resources in science education are made available to students based on the belief that they will improve coursebased student learning. This belief is ubiquitous, with supplemental resources being a traditional component of physiology education. In addition, the recent large-scale transition to remote learning caused by the Covid-19 pandemic suggests an increased relevance and necessity of digital versions of supplemental resources. However, the use of a supplemental resource is entirely dependent on whether students view it as beneficial. If students in a specific course do not perceive a supplemental resource as useful, there is little reason to believe the resources will be used and are worthy of investment. Consequently, measurement of student perception regarding the effectiveness of any digital learning tool is essential for educators and institutions in order to prioritize resources and make meaningful recommendations to students. In this study, a survey was used to determine student perceptions of a digital, supplemental resource. Quantitative methods, including exploratory factor analysis, were performed on data collected from the survey to examine the dimensionality and functionality of this survey. The findings from this study were used to devise an improved, standardized (i.e., reliable and valid) survey that can be used and adapted by physi3ology researchers and educators to determine student perception of a digital supplemental resource. The survey, with known construct validity and internal reliability, can provide useful information for administrators, instructors, and designers of digital supplemental resources.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Graduate doctors' knowledge of central and peripheral nervous system anatomy is below an acceptable level. New technologies have been introduced to enhance education in the context of integrated curricula and reduced anatomy teaching hours in medical schools. However, it is unknown how varied this instruction has become between universities. This mixed methods study aimed to describe neuroanatomy teaching in medicine across Australia and New Zealand.
   METHODS: An electronic survey was sent to Australian (n = 22) and New Zealand (n = 2) medical schools, endorsed by the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons. Academics were asked to comment on the course, content, instruction, and assessment of neuroanatomy for the 2019 academic year.
   RESULTS: Ninety-two percent (22/24) of medical schools responded. Neuroanatomy content and instructional methodology was highly variable between institutions. The average time dedicated to teaching neuroanatomy was 46.0 hours (+/- 38.1) with a range of 12-160 hours. Prosections (77%) and models (77%) were used at most universities. Dissection was utilized at 13 of 22 (59%) universities. Incorporation of new technologies was highly variable, the most common being 3-dimensional software (59%) and eBook (55%). Adoption of any virtual reality technologies was low (36%). Seven universities used an established curriculum (29%), whereas most did not (61%). Academics indicated anxiety and motivation were key elements of student engagement.
   CONCLUSIONS: Results demonstrate widespread heterogeneity in the way neuroanatomy is taught to medical students. A standardized curriculum may improve collaboration between universities and facilitate translation of future research in the area into practice.

AB  - The study of neuroanatomy imposes a significant cognitive load on students since it includes huge factual information and therefore demands diverse learning strategies. In addition, a significant amount of teaching is carried out through human brain demonstrations, due to limited opportunities for cadaveric dissection. However, reports suggest that students often attend these demonstrations with limited preparation, which detrimentally impacts their learning. In the context of student learning, greater levels of engagement and intrinsic motivation (IM) are associated with better academic performance. However, the maintenance of engagement and the IM of students in neuroanatomy is often challenging for educators. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the role of prelaboratory assignments (PLAs) in the improvement of academic performance, augmentation of engagement, and enhancement of IM in occupational therapy students enrolled in a human neuroanatomy course. One cohort of students in the course was expected to complete PLAs prior to each brain demonstration session. The PLAs contained a list of structures, and students were expected to write a brief anatomical description of each structure. Another cohort of students who were not provided with similar PLAs constituted the control group. Students who completed PLAs had a higher score on the final examinations as compared to students who were not required to complete PLAs. These students also demonstrated greater engagement and IM, and indicated that they perceived PLAs to be valuable in the learning of neuroanatomy. Therefore, PLAs represent a useful teaching tool in the neuroanatomy curriculum.

AB  - Background. Against the backdrop of the cognitive-motivational process model proposed by Vollmeyer and Rheinberg (1998), this study investigates how the personality trait need for cognition in combination with a specific situation (short and long version of a live-action simulation game), current motivation, and immersion and flow (mediators) predict the learning outcome in the simulation game EVERYDAY LIFE IN THE CLASSROOM (Starker & Imhof, 2014).
   Methods. N = 138 teacher students played the short 2-hour version of the simulation game, and N = 77 played the long 2-day version. Need for cognition, current motivation, immersion, flow, and learning outcome were measured by self-report questionnaires.
   Results. A hierarchical regression analysis was used to determine the impact of the predictor variables (need for cognition, current motivation, immersion, and flow) on the self-evaluated learning outcome. For the 2-hour group, the predictor variables interest, challenge, and immersion (subscale: engagement) impacted self-reported learning outcome significantly positive. For the 2-day group, significant predictors were need for cognition, interest, and immersion (subscale: engrossment). In comparison of the two game versions, students playing the 2-day version reported significantly higher levels of engagement, engrossment, and learning outcome.
   Conclusion. The cognitive-motivational process model of learning was partly supported: interest and immersion predict learning outcome in the live-action simulation game. The extended 2-day version of the game leads to higher levels of immersion and higher learning outcome, indicating that a longer timeframe secures the desired effects on learning outcome from simulation games. Further research needs to shed light on the interaction of personality traits and immersion.

AB  - We currently face significant, anthropogenic, global environmental challenges and the role of ecologists in mitigating these challenges is arguably more important than ever. Consequently there is an urgent need to recruit and train future generations of ecologists, both those whose main area is ecology, but also those involved in the geological, biological and environmental sciences. Here we present the results of a horizon scanning exercise that identified current and future challenges facing the teaching of ecology, through surveys of teachers, students and employers of ecologists. Key challenges identified were grouped in terms of the perspectives of three groups: students, for example the increasing disconnect between people and nature; teachers, for example the challenges associated with teaching the quantitative skills that are inherent to the study of ecology; and society, for example poor societal perceptions of the field of ecology. In addition to the challenges identified, we propose a number of solutions developed at a workshop by a team of ecology teaching experts, with supporting evidence of their potential to address many of the problems raised. These proposed solutions include developing living labs, teaching students to be ecological entrepreneurs and influencers, embedding skills-based learning and coding in the curriculum, an increased role for learned societies in teaching and learning, and using new technology to enhance fieldwork studies including virtual reality, artificial intelligence and real-time spoken language translation. Our findings are focused towards UK higher education, but they should be informative for students and teachers of a wide range of educational levels, policy makers and professional ecologists worldwide.

AB  - The use of digital teaching resources became widespread and very helpful during the COVID-19 pandemic as an alternative to a traditional course with cadavers. Technologies such as augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), 3D models, video lectures and other online resources enable three-dimensional visualization of the anatomical structures and allow students to learn more interactively. The aim of this study was to compare students' performance in the traditional anatomical courses in teaching neuroanatomy and technology-based learning methods such as video lectures, 3D models and 3D printed specimens. Four groups of first-year students of Veterinary Faculty established for the practical classes during the academic year 2021/2022 took part in this research. The total number of students participating in this research was 72. Each group attended separately the theoretical lecture with a demonstration based on a different technique; the control group used formalized specimens, while the three experimental groups used video lectures, 3D models and 3D printed specimens, respectively. Subsequently, all groups completed the same questionnaire testing their short-term memory of the neuroanatomical structures. After four weeks students were tested for their long-term memory of the neuroanatomy lecture with the follow-up test containing an identical list of questions. The test scores using video lectures and 3D printed models were significantly higher compared with the group that learned in the traditional way. This study suggests that alternative approaches such as technology-based digital methods can facilitate memorization of anatomical terms and structures in a more interactive and sensory engaging way of learning.

AB  - Education in veterinary medicine, as in other allied health care-health science professions and academia in general, has been subject to the public call for accountability for the quality of its student learning outcomes. A principal stakeholder in veterinary medicine is the American Veterinary Medical Association-Council on Education (AVMA-COE). AVMA-COE has adopted program accreditation standards requiring veterinary colleges to provide evidence that they are measuring and assessing the clinical competency of students before graduation and again shortly after graduation. Schools and colleges are required to develop relevant measures to validate scientific knowledge, skills, and values aligned with North American Veterinary Medical Education Consortium (NAVMEC) core competencies. Beginning in May 2012, the College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences at Texas A&M University modified the professional veterinary medical curriculum by including a required clinical rotation centered on veterinary emergency preparedness and response. A distinguishing major component of the instructional design of the clinical rotation includes Second Life, a commercially obtained computer-generated multi-user virtual simulation learning environment. The virtual reality situations require high-volume, mass-casualty medical triage decision making. The interpersonal communications and interactivity among students, faculty, and third-party actors enable faculty and instructor observers and simulation facilitators to evaluate students actively engaged in critical thinking and complex problem solving while demonstrating skill in the NAVMEC professional competencies. The Second Life virtual simulation has been adopted as a primary tool for direct measurement of student learning objectives outcomes achieved in this clinical rotation and is being implemented in other clinical teaching platforms.

AB  - The modern way of all society spheres development is sustainable and encourages the integration of the scientific processes. The transfer of ideas and research methods from one scientific area to another through the cognitive potential of different disciplines reflects this tendency. All these processes lead to a collaboration between the actual scientific and engineering spheres: the innovation projects today are characterized by increasing science-intensity, complexity and innovativeness, including not only technological, but also environmental, social, economic aspects. This multidimensionality determines the need for specialists who are able to find and solve complex professional tasks. It is this synthesis of science and production that can increase the competitiveness of the country's economy in the modern dynamics of all processes. Such conditions stimulate the interdisciplinary interaction in higher education institutions. In this respect the professional creativity of a technical specialist is important and is understood as the ability to create new products and get high performance results through the realization of the individual creative abilities. However, pedagogical science does not pay enough attention to the consideration of professional creativity in the context of creating and organizing the work of interdisciplinary project teams. The product of the team's activities is not presented in the light of its contribution to the formation of the student's professional personality. Therefore, in this paper we aim at revealing the potential of interdisciplinary interaction for the development of professional creativity, taking into account the characteristics of the product as a result of project activities.

AB  - Students in undergraduate premedical anatomy courses may experience suboptimal and superficial learning experiences due to large class sizes, passive lecture styles, and difficult-to-master concepts. This study introduces an innovative, hands-on activity for human musculoskeletal system education with the aim of improving students' level of engagement and knowledge retention. In this study, a collaborative learning intervention using the REFLECT (augmented reality for learning clinical anatomy) system is presented. The system uses the augmented reality magic mirror paradigm to superimpose anatomical visualizations over the user's body in a large display, creating the impression that she sees the relevant anatomic illustrations inside her own body. The efficacy of this proposed system was evaluated in a large-scale controlled study, using a team-based muscle painting activity among undergraduate premedical students (n = 288) at the Johns Hopkins University. The baseline knowledge and post-intervention knowledge of the students were measured before and after the painting activity according to their assigned groups in the study. The results from knowledge tests and additional collected data demonstrate that the proposed interactive system enhanced learning of the musculoskeletal system with improved knowledge retention (F-(10,F-133) = 3.14, P < 0.001), increased time on task (F-(1,F-275) = 5.70, P < 0.01), and a high level of engagement (F-(9,F-273) = 8.28, P < 0.0001). The proposed REFLECT system will be of benefit as a complementary anatomy learning tool for students.

AB  - Technological advancements have made it possible to create realistic virtual representations of the real world, although it is unclear in medical education whether high physical fidelity is required in virtual learning resources (VLRs). This study, therefore, aimed to compare the effectiveness of high-fidelity (HF) and low-fidelity (LF) VLRs for learning anatomy. For this study, HF and LF VLRs were developed for liver anatomy and participants were voluntarily recruited from two cohorts (cohorts 1 and 2). Knowledge outcomes were measured through pre- and post-tests, task outcomes including activity score and completion time were recorded and participants' perceptions of the VLRs were surveyed. A total of 333 participants (165 HF and 168 LF) took part in this study. Knowledge outcomes were higher for the HF activity in cohort 1 and for the LF activity in cohort 2, although not significantly. There were no significant differences in activity score within either cohort, although completion time was significantly longer for the HF activity in cohort 1 (P = 0.001). There were no significant differences within either cohort in perceptions of the VLRs regarding usefulness for reviewing conceptual knowledge, esthetics, quality, mental effort experienced, or future use, although the LF VLR was scored significantly higher regarding the value for understanding in cohort 1 (P = 0.027).This study suggests that high physical fidelity is not necessarily required for anatomy VLRs, although may potentially be valuable for improving knowledge outcomes. Also, level of prior knowledge may be an important factor when considering the physical fidelity of anatomy VLRs.

AB  - Three-dimensional (3D) digital anatomical models show potential to demonstrate complex anatomical relationships; however, the literature is inconsistent as to whether they are effective in improving the anatomy performance, particularly for students with low spatial visualization ability (Vz). This study investigated the educational effectiveness of a 3D stereoscopic model of the pelvis, and the relationship between learning with 3D models and Vz. It was hypothesized that participants learning with a 3D pelvis model would outperform participants learning with a two-dimensional (2D) visualization or cadaveric specimen on a spatial anatomy test, particularly when comparing those with low Vz. Participants (n = 64) were stratified into three experimental groups, who each attended a learning session with either a 3D stereoscopic model (n = 21), 2D visualization (n = 21), or cadaveric specimen (n = 22) of the pelvis. Medical and pre-medical student participants completed a multiple-choice pre-test and post-test during their respective learning session, and a long-term retention (LTR) test 2 months later. Results showed no difference in anatomy test improvement or LTR performance between the experimental groups. A simple linear regression analysis showed that within the 3D group, participants with high Vz tended to retain more than those with low Vz on the LTR test (R-2 = 0.31, P = 0.01). The low Vz participants may be cognitively overloaded by the complex spatial cues from the 3D stereoscopic model. Results of this study should inform resource selection and curriculum design for health professional students, with attention to the impact of Vz on learning.

AB  - The use of Augmented Reality (AR) in anatomical education has been promoted by numerous authors. Next to financial and ethical advantages, AR has been described to decrease cognitive load while increasing student motivation and engagement. Despite these advantages, the effects of AR on learning outcome varies in different studies and an overview and aggregated outcome on learning anatomy is lacking. Therefore, a meta-analysis on the effect of AR vs. traditional anatomical teaching methods on learning outcome was performed. Systematic database searches were conducted by two independent investigators using predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. This yielded five papers for meta-analysis totaling 508 participants; 240 participants in the AR-groups and 268 participants in the control groups. (306 females/202 males). Meta-analysis showed no significant difference in anatomic test scores between the AR group and the control group (- 0.765 percentage-points (%-points); P=0.732). Sub analysis on the use of AR vs. the use of traditional 2D teaching methods showed a significant disadvantage when using AR (- 5.685%-points; P=0.024). Meta-regression analysis showed no significant co-relation between mean difference in test results and spatial abilities (as assessed by the mental rotations test scores). Student motivation and/or engagement could not be included since studies used different assessment tools. This meta-analysis showed that insufficient evidence is present to conclude AR significantly impacts learning outcome and that outcomes are significantly impacted by students' spatial abilities. However, only few papers were suitable for meta-analysis, indicating that there is a need for more well-designed, randomized-controlled trials on AR in anatomy education research.

AB  - Interest in spatial ability has grown over the past few decades following the emergence of correlational evidence associating spatial aptitude with educational performance in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. The research field at large and the anatomy education literature on this topic are mixed. In an attempt to generate consensus, a meta-analysis was performed to objectively summarize the effects of spatial ability on anatomy assessment performance across multiple studies and populations. Relevant studies published within the past 50 years (1969-2019) were retrieved from eight databases. Study eligibility screening was followed by a full-text review and data extraction. Use of the Mental Rotations Test (MRT) was required for study inclusion. Out of 2,450 screened records, 15 studies were meta-analyzed. Seventy-three percent of studies (11 of 15) were from the United States and Canada, and the majority (9 of 15) studied professional students. Across 15 studies and 1,245 participants, spatial ability was weakly associated with anatomy performance (r(pooled) = 0.240; CI at 95% = 0.09, 0.38; P = 0.002). Performance on spatial and relationship-based assessments (i.e., practical assessments and drawing tasks) was correlated with spatial ability, while performance on assessments utilizing non-spatial multiple-choice items was not correlated with spatial ability. A significant sex difference was also observed, wherein males outperformed females on spatial ability tasks. Given the role of spatial reasoning in learning anatomy, educators are encouraged to consider curriculum delivery modifications and a comprehensive assessment strategy so as not to disadvantage individuals with low spatial ability.

AB  - New Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) are changing our life. Society, and especially its younger part, got used to everyday life in the digital space. People spend more and more time in this space. In many countries, the number of hours spent online exceeds eight per day. These statistics are dominated by young people who know the world using digital media. These trends must be used in many areas, including non-school and informal education of young people in the field of cultural heritage.
   The aim of the paper is to present an example of the use of new technologies for historical and cultural heritage education. The educational tool is an internet portal on which information on historical monuments lying on the medieval trade route called Silk Road is collected and made available to everyone free of charge. This route was the longest in history and connected the Chinese and European economy. Many cities were created, enriched and developed along it. Their remains are a worldwide cultural heritage.
   The portal is called 3D Digital Silk Road. It provides textual and multimedia information, using such new technologies as 3D models of museum artefacts, 3D panoramas of large architectural objects and virtual reality (VR). In addition to images, films and files for VR glasses, the portal contains reports from conferences and scientific expeditions related to the digitization of cultural heritage objects. The structure of the portal, the information available on it, and the form of it sharing are directed to increasing the interest of young people in the cultural heritage of Silk Road. The portal and its content are the result of international cooperation of computer science specialists and museologists.

AB  - Over 1.7 billion students around the world have had their education disrupted by the spread of the Coronavirus disease worldwide. Schools and universities have not faced this level of disruption since World War II. The COVID-19 pandemic presented a colossal challenge for teachers to urgently and massively adapt all their classes to distance learning in order to maintain educational continuity with the same quality. Even if some teachers and certain classes were ready to face the situation, a large majority had to adapt their teaching and learning in a very short time without training, with insufficient bandwidth, and with little preparation. This unexpected and rapid transition to online learning has led to a multiplication of teachers' strategies for distance learning in lectures, tutorials, project groups, lab works, and assessments. The purpose of this paper is to present the feedback from students and teachers who participated in the lockdown semester of two different groups of a 5-year program in Chemistry, Environment and Chemical Engineering (100 students) at INSA Toulouse (France). The analysis has highlighted some great successes and some failures in the solutions proposed. Consequently, some guidelines can be given to help us all to learn the lessons of such a singular experience in order to face the unexpected future with more knowledge and more successful distance learning. Teachers have shown very strong resilience during this crisis, at the cost of significant personal commitment. They admit that they have learned more about distance education in two months than in the last 10 years.

AB  - Spatial abilities have been correlated to anatomy knowledge assessment and spatial training has been found to improve spatial abilities in previous systematic reviews. The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate spatial abilities training in anatomy education. A literature search was done from inception to 3 August 2017 in Scopus (R) and several databases on the EBSCOhost platform. Citations were reviewed and those involving anatomy education, an intervention, and a spatial abilities test were retained and the corresponding full-text articles were reviewed for inclusion. Before and after training studies, as well as comparative training programs, relating a spatial training intervention to spatial abilities were eligible. Of the 2,405 citations obtained, 52 articles were identified and reviewed, yielding eight eligible articles. Instruction in anatomy and mental rotations training were found to improve spatial abilities. For the seven studies retained for the meta-analysis that included the effect of interventions on spatial abilities test scores, the pooled treatment effect difference was 0.49 (95% CI [0.17; 0.82]; n = 11) improvement. For the two studies that included the practice effect on spatial abilities test scores in a control group, the pooled treatment effect difference was 0.47 (95% CI [-0.03; 0.97]; n = 2) improvement. In these two studies, the impact of the intervention on spatial abilities test scores was found despite the practice effect. Evidence was found for improvement of spatial abilities in anatomy education using instruction in anatomy and mental rotations training.

AB  - The role and efficacy of the laboratory in chemical education have recently been a subject of renewed discussion as researchers are called upon to address the question of whether laboratory education lives up to expectations. The COVID-19 pandemic, which forced most of the global student population to temporarily adopt remote learning, offers an unparalleled case study to investigate types of outcomes resulting from a variety of adjustments made to laboratory education. This scoping review article focuses on the reports of laboratory learning in chemistry and closely related disciplines during COVID-19 to analyze the types of adjustments made to laboratory curricula and the immediate effect of these adjustments on students. The aggregated findings suggest that a lack of hands-on laboratory experience was detrimental to certain types of learning and engagement but that other types of learning were successfully achieved remotely. For researchers, departments, and university administrators, the differentiation in these findings could help inform the ongoing discussion about the future of laboratory education. For instructors and student support staff, the findings indicate potential areas of deficiency and strength for the COVID-19 student cohort going forward. Finally, a laboratory learning theory and pedagogy are proposed to guide the use of the laboratory in chemical education and potentially in other laboratory-based sciences as well.

AB  - The consolidation of technology as an alternative strategy to cadaveric dissection for teaching anatomy in medical courses was accelerated by the recent Covid-19 pandemic, which caused the need for social distance policies and the closure of laboratories and classrooms. Consequently, new technologies were created, and those already been developed started to be better explored. However, information about many of these instruments and resources is not available to anatomy teachers. This systematic review presents the technological means for teaching and learning about human anatomy developed and applied in medical courses in the last ten years, besides the infrastructure necessary to use them. Studies in English, Portuguese, and Spanish were searched in MEDLINE, Scopus, ERIC, LILACS, and SciELO databases, initially resulting in a total of 875 identified articles, from which 102 were included in the analysis. They were classified according to the type of technology used: three-dimensional (3D) printing (n = 22), extended reality (n = 49), digital tools (n = 23), and other technological resources (n = 8). It was made a detailed description of technologies, including the stage of the medical curriculum in which it was applied, the infrastructure utilized, and which contents were covered. The analysis shows that between all technologies, those related to the internet and 3D printing are the most applicable, both in student learning and the financial cost necessary for its structural implementation.

AB  - Background: An appreciation for complex three-dimensional relationships in neuroanatomy forms a fundamental tenet of neurosurgical education. The value of experience in the cadaver lab is indisputable; however, it is expensive and often inaccessible. The wide availability of 3D technologies has opened new possibilities, although scientific inaccuracy has hitherto limited their use. Objective: In the present study, we aim to describe a novel, literature-based process of scientific 3D modeling for the creation of neuroanatomical models adapted for mobile technology. Methods: A systematic literature review regarding current resources in neuroanatomy education was performed according to PRISMA guidelines. The composition of the team and the workflow behind the 3D Head Atlas app are also described. Results: A total of 101 manuscripts were reviewed, and 24 included. Cadaveric dissections improve the learning process, although high costs limit their availability. Digital advancements have partially overcome the limitations of dissection, and have been associated with improved knowledge retention. Nevertheless, 3D models are often inaccurate, poorly adapted to mobile hardware, and expensive. Recent technological advances provide a new way to widely disseminate complex 3D models, with a revolutionary impact on learning. The approach behind the 3D Head Atlas app, based on the synergistic work of scientific and development teams, facilitates the creation of interactive 3D scientific material with high accuracy and wide accessibility. Conclusion: The study of neuroanatomy is intimately related to the evolution of digital technology. Traditional methods (i.e. cadaveric dissections) have undisputed value but high costs. High-fidelity 3D scenarios and mobile devices may revolutionize learning if based on a sound evidence-based approach.

AB  - Neuroanatomy has been deemed crucial for clinical neurosciences. It has been one of the most challenging parts of the anatomical curriculum and is one of the causes of "neurophobia," whose main implication is a negative influence on the choice of neurology in the near future. In the last decades, several educational strategies have been identified to improve the skills of students and to promote a deep learning. The aim of this study was to systematically review the literature to identify the most effective method/s to teach human neuroanatomy. The search was restricted to publications written in English language and to articles describing teaching tools in undergraduate medical courses from January 2006 through December 2017. The primary outcome was the observation of improvement of anatomical knowledge in undergraduate medical students. Secondary outcomes were the amelioration of long-term retention knowledge and the grade of satisfaction of students. Among 18 selected studies, 44.4% have used three-dimensional (3D) teaching tools, 16.6% near peer teaching tool, 5.55% flipped classroom tool, 5.55% applied neuroanatomy elective course, 5.55% equivalence-based instruction-rote learning, 5.55% mobile augmented reality, 5.55% inquiry-based clinical case, 5.55% cadaver dissection, and 5.55% Twitter. The high in-between study heterogeneity was the main issue to identify the most helpful teaching tool to improve neuroanatomical knowledge among medical students. Data from this study suggest that a combination of multiple pedagogical resources seems to be the more advantageous for teaching neuroanatomy.

AB  - Having proficiency in the standard aviation phraseology specified by International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) is of great importance for prospective pilots in communication with air traffic controllers and other pilots. The ambiguity in the standard phraseology could be a disaster for the flight crews. Serious thought, thus, has been given to the policy of improving precise communication in aviation. However, it remains unclear whether the serious game-based flight simulations can enhance the vocabulary intake of the learners who invest the majority of their time in studying the standard aviation phraseology. There is also a dearth of research pertaining to the association between serious gaming and aviation phraseology. The advancement of technology has exponentially expanded digital games and therefore began to be widely used in education. The current study thus sets out to investigate the effect of a serious simulation game X-Plane 11 offering an invaluable learning experience on aviation vocabulary acquisition. This investigation takes the form of quasi-experimental mixed-method research by retrieving convenience sampling (15 subjects in the experimental group, 15 subjects in the control group). The findings indicated that there was strong evidence of the positive effects of serious gaming on the learners' outcomes. Following the integration of the serious game, a significant increase in the medium effect size in the experimental group was recorded. This finding was also echoed by the majority of the interviewees who unanimously emphasized that the game was beneficial and motivating for language learning despite the minority challenges triggered by the level of language, hardware, and software types.

AB  - Planetariums were created to teach astronomy by simulating motions of the star-filled night sky; however, simply having a virtual reality facility to immerse learners beneath a projected night sky in and of itself is insufficient to automatically ensure student learning occurs. Modern teaching strategies, like active learning, have consistently shown to move students toward deeper understanding in classrooms; yet, active learning approaches seem to be only rarely observed in planetariums. Use of Ruiz-Primo and Furtak's (2006) coding scheme to define and analyze formative assessment conversations between classroom teachers and students reveals that unless teachers are formally taught how to use formative assessment-based active learning, such approaches are largely absent in classrooms studied. The goal of this 2-phase study was to evaluate the nature of active learning-based formative assessment conversation cycles in the planetarium. The first phase systematically analyzes 26 recordings of live planetarium programs to describe and document presence of active learning teaching strategies. The second phase conducts interviews to determine rewards and barriers to using formative assessment-based active learning in the planetarium. Analysis suggests scant evidence of complete formative assessment conversation cycles, despite that varying degrees of interactivity between the planetarium lecturer and the audience do exist. It is not that planetarians don't ask questions, but responses rarely serve to systematically guide instructional decisions aligned with modern pedagogy. Moreover, these planetarians hold a wide range of definitions of what constitutes active learning and often view their primary responsibility as inspiration rather than education, lending explanatory power to why active learning is largely absent.

AB  - Purpose/Objectives To assess student perceptions on learning dental anatomy using natural extracted teeth, 3D printed models, 3D virtual models, and augmented reality (AR) technology. Methods Eighty first-year dental students enrolled in the dental anatomy course were instructed to examine four stations. The stations included four versions of a mandibular first molar: an extracted natural tooth, a 3D printed model, a 3D virtual model, and a model displayed on a novel AR device. After examining all stations, the students were asked to complete an electronic survey. Bivariate analysis was performed to determine whether students' perceptions are related to their demographic characteristics and technological experience with computer use, 3D modeling, and video games. Results Seventy students completed the survey (87.5% response rate). Students rated natural teeth to have the highest educational value, the 3D printed tooth to be the most accessible, and the AR application to be the most interesting modality. Students who played little to no video games were more likely to rate AR as high educational value (48.8% vs. 10.3%; p < 0.001), while students with little 3D modeling experience were more likely to rate high accessibility of the 3D Model (78.1% vs. 48.3%; p < 0.001). No statistically significant associations between the perceptions and students' demographic characteristics or use of computer were noted. Conclusion The natural extracted tooth was rated highest in educational value, while the 3D printed model was rated easiest to use, and the AR model was the most interesting to the students.

AB  - The use of augmented reality (AR) in teaching and studying neuroanatomy has been well researched. Previous research showed that AR-based learning of neuroanatomy has both alleviated cognitive load and was attractive to young learners. However, how the attractiveness of AR effects student motivation has not been discovered. Therefore, the motivational effects of AR were investigated in this research by the use of quantitative and qualitative methods. Motivation elicited by the GreyMapp-AR, an AR application, was investigated in medical and biomedical sciences students (n = 222; mean age: 19.7 +/- 1.4 years) using the instructional measure of motivation survey (IMMS). Additional components (i.e., attention, relevance, confidence, and satisfaction) were also evaluated with motivation as measured by IMMS. Additionally, 19 students underwent audio-recorded individual interviews which were transcribed for qualitative analysis. Males regarded the relevance of AR significantly higher than females (P < 0.024). Appreciation of the GreyMapp-AR program was found to be significantly higher in students studying biomedical sciences as compared to students studying medicine (P < 0.011). Other components and scores did not show significant differences between student groups. Students expressed that AR was beneficial in increasing their motivation to study subcortical structures, and that AR could be helpful and motivating for preparing an anatomy examination. This study suggests that students are motivated to study neuroanatomy by the use of AR, although the components that make up their individual motivation can differ significantly between groups of students.

AB  - Spatial understanding of complex anatomical concepts is often a challenge for learners, as well as for educators. It is even more challenging for students with low mental spatial abilities. There are many options to teach spatial relationships, ranging from simple models to high-end three-dimensional (3D) virtual reality tools. Using a randomized controlled trial design, this study explored the use of a unique combination of deictic and iconic hand gestures to enhance spatial anatomical understanding, coining the term "Air Anatomy". The control group (n = 45) was given a lecture on the anatomy of extraocular muscles, while the intervention group (n = 49) received the same lecture including "Air Anatomy" hand gestures. When compared to the control group, the post-test scores for the intervention group were significantly higher for basic recall (P U test) and for the application of knowledge (P = 0.015; Mann-Whitney U test). Students with low to moderate spatial ability (as assessed by a mental rotation test) were found to benefit most by this technique. Students in the intervention group also reported a lower extrinsic cognitive load and higher germane load, when compared to the control group. An instructional skills questionnaire survey indicated the effectiveness of this technique in improving overall classroom experience. Feedback of the students in the intervention group was also favorable for instruction using "Air Anatomy". The study suggests that "Air Anatomy" is a useful, "no-cost", accessible method that aids spatial understanding of anatomical concepts.

AB  - By combining elements of entertainment with creative writing, theater and technology, the increasingly popular live-action games escape rooms have the potential to improve the learning experience when used in academic settings. However, since educational escape rooms are still an emerging field, there is limited literature available about their use in STEAM education. The present paper addresses this issue by describing the methods followed by 39, 16 to 18-year-old, students and 10 teachers at a Vocational School of Greece to implement a STEAM-focused escape room activity using the Experiential Pyramid Model. The escape room was themed after the Spanish heist television series "La Casa de Papel" and incorporated creative writing, theatrical elements, and technology, such as Robotics, QR codes and Virtual Reality (VR), to promote communication, teamwork and peer learning. To make the experience more immersive, two team members had the roles of non-player characters (NPCs), and interacted with the players throughout the game, with a small script written during the design and evaluation phase. This collaborative activity was assessed via evaluation questionnaires, direct/participatory observation and interviews. The first results indicated that students were highly engaged and motivated especially at the design phase. They valued this pedagogical approach positively, since it facilitated the integration of contents of various subjects and enabled them to collaborate with their peers from different cohorts, thus promoting peer learning. This study aims to provide educators with an example of how they might develop and support non-traditional approaches to learning by immersing their students as active participants in the learning environment and allowing them to develop and apply knowledge, so to create a gameplay.

AB  - Neuroanatomy education is a challenging field which could benefit from modern innovations, such as augmented reality (AR) applications. This study investigates the differences on test scores, cognitive load, and motivation after neuroanatomy learning using AR applications or using cross-sections of the brain. Prior to two practical assignments, a pretest (extended matching questions, double-choice questions and a test on cross-sectional anatomy) and a mental rotation test (MRT) were completed. Sex and MRT scores were used to stratify students over the two groups. The two practical assignments were designed to study (1) general brain anatomy and (2) subcortical structures. Subsequently, participants completed a posttest similar to the pretest and a motivational questionnaire. Finally, a focus group interview was conducted to appraise participants' perceptions. Medical and biomedical students (n = 31); 19 males (61.3%) and 12 females (38.7%), mean age 19.2 +/- 1.7 years participated in this experiment. Students who worked with cross-sections (n = 16) showed significantly more improvement on test scores than students who worked with GreyMapp-AR (P = 0.035) (n = 15). Further analysis showed that this difference was primarily caused by significant improvement on the cross-sectional questions. Students in the cross-section group, moreover, experienced a significantly higher germane (P = 0.009) and extraneous cognitive load (P = 0.016) than students in the GreyMapp-AR group. No significant differences were found in motivational scores. To conclude, this study suggests that AR applications can play a role in future anatomy education as an add-on educational tool, especially in learning three-dimensional relations of anatomical structures.

AB  - The Verb Collective is a toolkit designed to aid instructors in teaching virtual and augmented reality to artists and creatives who are exploring the medium of immersive technologies but who might have little or no background in coding. It is designed to fit seamlessly into the interface of the popular Unity development platform and, though it leverages some of the same structures of visual coding environments, it is intentionally designed without specialized interfaces. Though it has been found that visual scripting environments offer useful tools for rapid prototyping they also constrain students to the structures they employ while also teaching them a set of tools subject to change or becoming unusable if the proprietary codebase is not regularly updated. The Verb Collective is designed to be modular and lightweight and for student expertise in its functions to be directly transferable to the Unity platform as well as other similar platforms. While other popular toolkits are focused either on rapid production or on teaching code itself, the Verb Collective is focused on emergent dynamics and exploratory play with code. This model is suited to people whose interest in immersive environments and interactivity is spurred by creative pursuits. The modularity of the system is such that while it is limited in scope it is highly customizable. Designed with three tiers of users in mind, it functions as well for beginners as it does for more skilled developers. Focusing on the expressive qualities of the medium and on the the dynamic and emergent interplay of simple elements is a strategy designed to make the platform of VR and AR accessible to a broader range of people for whom novel experiences are privileged over interaction with existing industries or models.

AB  - This paper proposes an experience-based lecture style that offers dual-scale experiments in combination. Lectures for vibration engineering were designed based on the proposed style and offered to undergraduate students. In the proposed style, experiments on free vibration on a seismic building for second-year students and advanced vibration control using an effective device for fourth-year students are examined in combination. The lecture style trials were repeated twice, once each in 2015 and 2016, with about two hundred second-year students; the students felt the free vibration of the five-story building which had a 6,100 ton weight inside and witnessed the mechanism of the base-isolated layer. To follow the demonstration steps, we developed an experimental device. The experimental device is composed of a vibration component corresponding to a building, and a motor cart with a handle corresponding to the ground. These are connected via a linear actuator that can exert one-dimensional force on the vibration component as a function of the input voltage. In the lectures conducted in 2017 and 2018, the students oscillate the cart and observe the motion of the vibration component. In addition, the virtual reality cameras for offering students a visually rich experience attracted students' interest. The questionnaire results showed that almost all of the students valued the lectures as useful. Since most of the students answered that the combination of the large-scale demonstration and scale-down experiment was useful, the proposed lecture style achieved the expected overall goals.

AB  - This paper sheds light on the application of non-traditional methods during the teaching of architecture courses at the Jordanian universities, and shows its effect in refining the students' personality and increasing their community responsibility. The creativity in architecture depends on the ability to design a unique work that balances the architectural vision and the users' requirements. This comprehensive understanding of design raises many questions about the contribution of architectural education in the refinement of interactive thinking for the students of architecture - the architects of the future - and in the development of the students' sense of community to recognize the design process as a creative process that meets the needs of society. Therefore, it was necessary to develop some teaching methods in architecture and design that focus on the social dimension of the built environment. This paper aims to create interactive learning environments that empower the youth and enrich their personalities at the schools of architecture in Jordan. Traditional teaching methods, based on memorizing and using the existing media such as diagrams or pictures, have proven deficiency in transferring the architectural knowledge from the teacher to the students. However, the proposed interactive methods will bridge the gap between theory and practice by encouraging the students to interact with the design environment and members of the community to understand their needs prior starting the design. In this research, the concept of interactive learning is not limited to the use of the new interactive technology such as multimedia software, and Virtual Reality, but it is widen to include the notion of the human interacting with the designed environment by visiting the site, communicating with the users of the space, and enhancing the public participation.

AB  - Medical education is constantly evolving, especially as students were forced to study from home during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and new technologies have driven the rapid development of supplemental online educational resources. In this study, we examine if 360 degrees videos can promote increased engagement over standard two-dimensional (2D) videos among medical students learning anatomy. We enrolled 39 fourth-year medical students to watch two four-minute videos of anatomy lab exercises in a 360 degrees three-dimensional format using an immersive headset or in a 2D format on a laptop computer. Every two minutes, students were asked to rate their engagement from 0-100. Following the videos, they reported their degree of agreement with 14 statements related to engagement, practicality, and interest in the technology. While watching the videos, the average engagement reported by the 360 degrees video group was higher at each time point than the engagement reported by the two-dimensional group. Further, the engagement remained high in the 360 degrees group through the six- and eight-minute timepoints. In the postvideo survey, the 360 degrees group reported a statistically significantly higher average engagement in seven of eight measures on the assessment. A 360 degrees video was rated as more practical and interesting than a twodimensional video. No significant difference existed in the perceived ease of learning. Overall, the use of 360 degrees video may improve engagement for short videos used in medical education. However, developing a better understanding of its impact on learning outcomes will be critical for determining the overall value and effectiveness of this tool.

AB  - Histology, the branch of anatomy also known as microscopic anatomy, is the study of the structure and function of the body's tissues. To gain an understanding of the tissues of the body is to learn the foundational underpinnings of anatomy and achieve a deeper, more intimate insight into how the body is constructed, functions, and undergoes pathological change. Histology, therefore, is an integral element of basic science education within today's medical curricula. Its development as a discipline is inextricably linked to the evolution of the technology that allows us to visualize it. This chapter takes us on the journey through the past, present, and future of histology and its education; from technologies grounded in ancient understanding and control of the properties of light, to the ingenuity of crafting glass lenses that led to the construction of the first microscopes; traversing the second revolution in histology through the development of modern histological techniques and methods of digital and virtual microscopy, which allows learners to visualize histology anywhere, at any time; to the future of histology that allows flexible self-directed learning through social media, live-streaming, and virtual reality as a result of the powerful smart technologies we all carry around in our pockets. But, is our continuous pursuit of technological advancement projecting us towards a dystopian world where machines with artificial intelligence learn how to read histological slides and diagnose the diseases in the very humans that built them?

AB  - There is a pressing need for simulated forms of medical, and in particular, anatomical learning. Current modalities of teaching are limited to either traditional 2-dimensional forms of learning, such as textbook, research papers and lectures, or more costly 3-dimensional modes including cadaveric dissection. Despite the overwhelmingly 3-dimensional nature of plastic surgery, virtual 3D models are limited. Here, we provide the first description of the development and utilisation of a virtual 3D flap model in medical education in the undergraduate curriculum.
   Methods and results: A 3D anterolateral (ALT) model was developed with close integration of specialists in simulation and visualisation, anatomists and clinicians, allowing `virtual dissection' of the anatomy of the ALT flap. This was utilised in a B.Sc. Anatomy undergraduate course in 2017/18 and 2018/19. Student feedback noted an overwhelming preference for the 3D model (74%) as the first choice of educational methodology, versus lectures (26%), textbooks (0%) and research papers (0%) (p = 0.0035). Extraneous cognitive load may be reduced with 3D models, with students rating these as easier to learn from than textbook or research papers (p = 0.00014 and p < 0.00001, respectively). Notably, no statistically significant difference was found in the perceived ease of learning between 3D models and lectures.
   Conclusions: This study highlights a striking user preference for virtual 3D models as compared to for traditional teaching methods. Nonetheless, 3D models are likely to enhance rather than replace lectures, with this study suggesting that teaching by experts is likely to remain an essential part of medical education.

AB  - Educational technologies in veterinary medicine aim to train veterinarians faster and improve clinical outcomes. COVID-19 pandemic, shifted face-to-face teaching to online, thus, the need to provide effective education remotely was exacerbated. Among recent technology advances for veterinary medical education, extended reality (XR) is a promising teaching tool. This study aimed to develop a case resolution approach for radiographic anatomy studies using XR technology and assess students' achievement of differential diagnostic skills. Learning objectives based on Bloom's taxonomy keywords were used to develop four clinical cases (3 dogs/1 cat) of spinal injuries utilizing CT scans and XR models and presented to 22 third-year veterinary medicine students. Quantitative assessment (ASMT) of 7 questions probing 'memorization', 'understanding and application', 'analysis' and 'evaluation' was given before and after contact with XR technology as well as qualitative feedback via a survey. Mean ASMT scores increased during case resolution (pre 51.6% (+/- 37%)/post 60.1% (+/- 34%); p < 0.01), but without significant difference between cases (Kruskal-Wallis H = 2.18, NS). Learning objectives were examined for six questions (Q1-Q6) across cases (C1-4): Memorization improved sequentially (Q1, 2 8/8), while Understanding and Application (Q3,4) showed the greatest improvement (26.7%-76.9%). Evaluation and Analysis (Q5,6) was somewhat mixed, improving (5/8), no change (3/8) and declining (1/8).Positive student perceptions suggest that case studies' online delivery was well received stimulating learning in diagnostic imaging and anatomy while developing visual-spatial skills that aid understanding cross-sectional images. Therefore, XR technology could be a useful approach to complement radiological instruction in veterinary medicine

AB  - Previous research in technology-enhanced learning suggests that realism in visualizations can overwhelm learners and lower their learning performance. However, some studies offer evidence that realism may be helpful in learning tests that require detailed visual knowledge. A potential mechanism may be that realistic details act as retrieval cues (i.e., visual cues that facilitate retrieval during testing). In order to assess the impact of realism in learning and testing, we conducted an experiment (N = 40) using realistic and schematic renderings generated for this study. Realism was varied as a between-subjects factor while participants completed both a schematic and realistic retention test. As hypothesized, a realistic test visualization primarily benefits those who had learned using a realistic rather than a schematic visualization. In addition, the realistic test led to higher retention scores regardless of the realism level of the learning materials. A second experiment (n = 50) was conducted to assess whether schematic visualizations can be made more learner-friendly by including verbal descriptions that enhance the less detailed visualizations with additional cues. The experiment revealed that learning with schematic visualizations can be fostered using verbal descriptions for a multiple-choice retention test, but at the cost of lower scores in an image-based retention test. Both studies suggest that matching the realism and concreteness in the learning and testing stages lead to the best performance. Our results have implications for the design of a range of technology-enhanced learning contexts such as virtual reality education.

AB  - Purpose - This study aims to advance the proposal to use immersive virtual learning environments to stimulate and reveal deep-seated knowledge about science, giving instructors and researchers unique possibilities for assessing and identifying intuitive physical science knowledge. Aside from the ability to present rich and dynamic stimuli, these environments afford bodily enactment of people's understanding, which draws less from declarative knowledge stores and more from everyday experiences with the physical world.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors ground their proposal in a critical review of the impact of stimulus and task characteristics of traditional physics inventories. Using a grounded theory approach, the authors present classifications and interpretations of observed bodily enactments of physics understandings in a study where participants enacted their understanding of force and motion of space in an immersive, interactive mixed reality (MR) environment.
   Findings - The authors find that instances of these action categories can be interpreted as relating to underlying knowledge, often identified by other studies. The authors thus replicate a number of prior findings, which provide evidence to establish validation for using MR simulation as a tool for identifying people's physical intuitions.
   Research limitations/implications - This study targeted only a few specific physical science scenarios. Further, while a number of key insights about student knowledge came from the analysis, many of the observations are mere leads in need of further investigation and interpretation rather than core findings.
   Originality/value - Immersive digital learning environments are primarily used for instruction. The authors propose to use and design them for assessment as well. This paper should prompt more research and development in this direction.

AB  - Background Computer-assisted learning has been shown to be an effective means of teaching anatomy, with 3-D visualization technology more successfully improving participants' factual and spatial knowledge in comparison to traditional methods. To date, however, the effectiveness of teaching ear anatomy using 3-D holographic technology has not been studied. The present study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of learning ear anatomy using a holographic (HG) anatomic model in comparison to didactic lecture (DL) and a computer module (CM). Methods A 3-D anatomic model of the middle and inner ear was created and displayed using presentation slides in a lecture, computer module, or via the Microsoft HoloLens. Twenty-nine medical students were randomized to one of the three interventions. All participants underwent assessment of baseline knowledge of ear anatomy. Immediately following each intervention, testing was repeated along with completion of a satisfaction survey. Results Baseline test scores did not differ across intervention groups. All groups showed an improvement in anatomic knowledge post-intervention (p < 0.001); the improvement was equal across all interventions (p = 0.06). Participants rated the interventions equally for delivery of factual content (p = 0.96), but rated the HG higher than the DL and CM for overall effectiveness, ability to convey spatial relationships, and for learner engagement and motivation (p < 0.001). Conclusions These results suggest that 3-D holographic technology is an effective method of teaching ear anatomy as compared to DLs and CMs. Furthermore, it is better at engaging and motivating learners compared to traditional methods, meriting its inclusion as a tool in undergraduate medical education curriculum.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Visuospatial features of neuroanatomy are likely the most difficult concepts to learn in anatomy. Three-dimensional (3D) modalities have gradually begun to supplement traditional 2-dimensionanl representations of dissections and illustrations. We have introduced and described the workflow of 2 innovative methods-photogrammetry (PGM) and structured light scanning (SLS)which have typically been used for reverse-engineering applications. In the present study, we have described a novel application of SLS and PGM that could enhance medical education and operative planning in neurosurgery.
   METHODS: We have described the workflow of SLS and PGM for creating volumetric models (VMs) of neuroanatomical dissections, including the requisite equipment and software. We have also provided step-by-step procedures on how users can postprocess and refine these images according to their specifications. Finally, we applied both methods to 3 dissected hemispheres to demonstrate the quality of the VMs and their applications.
   RESULTS: Both methods yielded VMs with suitable clarity and structural integrity for anatomical education, surgical illustration, and procedural simulation.
   CONCLUSIONS: The application of 3D computer graphics to neurosurgical applications has shown great promise. SLS and PGM can facilitate the construction of VMs with high accuracy and quality that can be used and shared in a variety of 3D platforms. Similarly, the technical demands are not high; thus, it is plausible that neurosurgeons could become quickly proficient and enlist their use in education and surgical planning. Although SLS is preferable in settings in which high accuracy is required, PGM is a viable alternative with a short learning curve.

AB  - Objectives: The features that contribute to the apparent effectiveness of three-dimensional visualisation technology [3DVT] in teaching anatomy are largely unknown. The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the role of stereopsis in learning anatomy with 3DVT.
   Methods: The review was conducted and reported according to PRISMA Standards. Literature search of English articles was performed using EMBASE, MEDLINE, CINAHL EBSCOhost, ERIC EBSCOhost, Cochrane CENTRAL, Web of Science and Google Scholar databases until November 2019. Study selection, data extraction and study appraisal were performed independently by two authors. Articles were assessed for methodological quality using the Medical Education Research Study Quality Instrument and the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing the risk of bias. For quantitative analysis, studies were grouped based on relative between-intervention differences in instructional methods and type of control conditions.
   Results: A total of 3934 citations were obtained of which 67 underwent a full-text review. Ultimately, 13 randomised controlled trials were included in the meta-analysis. When interactive, stereoscopic 3D models were compared to interactive, monoscopic 3D models within a single level of instructional design, for example isolating stereopsis as the only true manipulated element in the experimental design, an effect size [ES] of 0.53 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.26-0.80;P < .00001) was found. In comparison with 2D images within multiple levels of instructional design, an effect size of 0.45 (95% CI 0.10-0.81;P < .002) was found. Stereopsis had no effect on learning when utilised with non-interactive 3D images (ES = -0.87, 95% CI -2.09-0.35;P = .16).
   Conclusion: Stereopsis is an important distinguishing element of 3DVT that has a significant positive effect on acquisition of anatomical knowledge when utilised within an interactive 3D environment. A distinction between stereoscopic and monoscopic 3DVT is essential to make in anatomical education and research.

AB  - This systematic review aimed to identify the level of impact of educational strategies for teaching tooth carving on the carving ability of undergraduate dental students. The PubMed-NCBI, Cochrane-CENTRAL, LILACS, Ibecs, BBO, Web of Science, and Scopus databases were searched in May 2019, for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and two-arm non-randomized studies of interventions (NRSI) addressing educational interventions toward the dental carving of undergraduate students. Studies from the year 2000 until the search date, written in English, Portuguese, and Spanish were included. Study screening and data extraction were performed in duplicate and blinded. The data were presented narratively, considering the dental carving ability of students the primary outcome. The risk of bias was assessed using the RoB tool 2.0 and ROBINS-I, and the level of evidence was determined with GRADE. Of 3,574 studies, 6 were included, with 3 RCTs and 3 NRSIs. Very low level of evidence was provided from the NRSIs that flipped classroom (1 study; n = 140) and a student-driven revised module (1 study; n = 264) improved the carving ability of students. Additionally, there was moderate evidence of online complementary material (1 RCT; n = 30) and reinforcement class improving the carving ability of students (1 RCT; n = 29). The replacement of traditional classes by an instructional DVD (1 RCT; n = 73) and assessment of carving projects through digital systems (1 NRSI; n = 79) did not enhance the carving ability of students. Study design, risk of bias, and imprecision downgraded the level of evidence. There was a very low to moderate evidence on the effectiveness of student-driven educational approaches and complementary classes of dental anatomy in improving the dental carving ability of students.

AB  - Purpose - the purpose of this research is to review the contents of Latvian teacher training and education programs in order to identify if the development of students' e-competences is included into these programs as an important objective and value. The importance of the development of these competences has been stressed in various EU documents and scientific literature. The scientific importance of the paper lies in gathering evidence for the inclusion of e-competences into teacher training and education curricula and demonstrating that e-competences have not yet acquired a value status in teacher training and education programs.
   Research methodology - the methodology included the keyword in context and concordance analysis of self-assessment reports and program descriptions, which were run in the software AntConc.
   Findings - out of 190,000 word tokens, the KWIC analysis identified only 75 entries related to e-competences, most of which included basic skills of information and communication technologies. Other more advanced concepts, such as virtual reality, artificial intelligence, adaptive spaces, e-competences, e-education and e-learning, were hardly mentioned.
   Research limitations - one limitation of this research is the focus on Latvian teacher training and education programs without their comparison to similar European programs, which would allow for determining the competitiveness of such Latvian programs in Europe.
   Practical implications - the obtained results suggest that the development of e-competences has not been perceived as value in teacher training and education programs in Latvia, and in order to bridge this gap, programming and artificial intelligence courses should be introduced into the curricula of such programs.
   Originality/Value - the research has demonstrated that the EU aim of boosting the competitiveness of the European education through the development of e-competences is yet to be implemented into teacher training and education programs in Latvia.

AB  - The article analyzes innovative approaches to improving business competencies and managerial skills in the hospitality industry. The factors influencing the development of the hotel manager's competencies and approaches to managing the implementation of educational services are studied on the example of using business simulation. Business theories, difficult to understand and implement in practice, the lack of effective educational technologies that allow students to apply practical managerial skills in the uncertain external and internal environment of the hotel enterprise recede into the past. The use of innovative business simulation technology solves this problem and is also an objective means of assessing the qualifications of the management team of the hotel enterprise and an incentive for continuous improvement of practical competencies. The aim of the present work is to study the factors of the development, implementation of business simulations for training in the hospitality industry, and to offer recommendations for sustainable development of application of business simulations for training in the hospitality industry based on the objective investigation. A comprehensive study of the business simulation impact on the quality of practical training has shown that it has improved the ability of participants involved in business simulation to make analytical decisions. The dynamic nature of the simulation encourages a competitive spirit in participants and allows them to acquire practical skills of working in a team and solving problems. Business simulations are also an objective evaluation tool for the qualifications of the hotel management team and an incentive for continuous improvement of practical competencies. The application of modern technologies, such as cloud services and virtual reality, will help to improve the quality of the simulation contents, while simultaneously increasing the number of participants, maintaining at the same time high emotional involvement of all participants of the business simulation.

AB  - This paper presents three experiments to assess the impact of gamifying an audience response system on the perceptions and educational performance of students. An audience response system called SIDRA (Immediate Audience Response System in Spanish) and two audience response systems with gamification features, R-G-SIDRA (gamified SIDRA with ranking) and RB-G-SIDRA (gamified SIDRA with ranking and badges), were used in a General and Descriptive Human Anatomy course. Students participated in an empirical study. In the academic year 2019-2020, a total of 90 students used RB-G-SIDRA, 90 students employed R-G-SIDRA in the academic year 2018-2019, and 92 students used SIDRA in the academic year 2017-2018. Statistically significant differences were found between final exam grades obtained by using RB-G-SIDRA and SIDRA, U = 39.211 adjusted p = 0.001 and RB-G-SIDRA and R-G-SIDRA U = 31.157 adjusted p = 0.015, thus finding strong evidence with respect to the benefit of the badges used in RB-G-SIDRA. Moreover, in the students' SIDRA systems scores, statistically significant differences were found between RB-G-SIDRA and SIDRA, U = -90.521 adjusted p < 0.001, and between R-G-SIDRA and SIDRA, U = -87.998 adjusted p < 0.001. Significant correlations between individual and team scores were also found in all of the tests in RB-G-SIDRA and G-SIDRA. The students expressed satisfaction, engagement, and motivation with SIDRA, R-G-SIDRA, and RB-G-SIDRA, thus obtaining a final average assessment of 4.28, 4.61, and 4.47 out of 5, respectively. Students perform better academically with gamified versus non-gamified audience response systems. Findings can be used to build a gamified adaptive learning system.

AB  - Background: Modern medical pedagogical strategies are shifting toward the use of virtual patient simulations.
   Objective: This study aims to examine students' users' attitudes and experiences and clinical facilitators' perspectives on student performances in the clinical setting post-virtual patient training.
   Design: A descriptive qualitative study design was used.
   Setting: Nursing faculty at a local university in Singapore.
   Participants: 24 nursing undergraduates and six clinical facilitators.
   Methods: This study is a follow-up of an experimental study on the Virtual Counseling Application Using Artificial Intelligence (VCAAI). The study took place from the academic year 2017/2018 ended in November 2019. Focus group discussions and individual interviews were conducted. All interviews and focus group discussions were audiotaped, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using thematic analysis.
   Results: Two overarching themes (students' virtual patient user experience and clinical facilitators' evaluations of students' clinical communication skills) comprising six themes were generated. Themes under students' user experience included: 1) attitudes toward virtual patient training, 2) virtual patient's role in student development, and 3) enhanced features and implementation suggestions. Themes under clinical facilitators' evaluations included: 1) insights on students' communication skills and 2) approaches to improve communication skills. An overlapping theme titled 'value of technology in teaching communication' comprised of mutual feedback from both students and clinical facilitators. Early implementation, continued accessibility, enhancing realism and technological improvements to the VCAAI were listed as key areas for program improvement, while increased situational sensitivity and language training are recommended to further enhance students' communication skills.
   Conclusion: The mixed attitudes toward virtual patient interactions and recognitions of the benefits of virtual patient simulations suggest the potential effectiveness of the use of virtual patients in teaching effective nursing communication skills. However, the lack of authenticity and other limitations need to be addressed before official implementations of such trainings with virtual patients to undergraduate nursing curricula.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to discuss the effects of visuals, visual literacy, visualization and multimedia design strategies using instructional design (ID) models for developing projects in education and science education, as well as engineering education. This study discusses and presents ways to evaluate visuals, visualization, and virtual technologies (as VR/AR and 2D-3D) in science education and engineering education based on research and foundations of visual learning, visual thinking, and visual communication. This study is a literature review work concerning visual effects, visual literacy, learner perceptions and technological variables for designing multimedia instruction and learning projects in visualization. In addition, this paper discusses similarities and constraints in using ID models for designing multimedia projects from the perspective of the use of visuals and ID models for developing visual materials in education. These procedures include the perceptual and theoretical foundations of visual learning, cognitive factors of visual images, visual design and program of systematic evaluation steps, as well as multimedia projects design and development materials with ID models, such as the decide, design, develop, and evaluate (DDD-E) model (Ivers, Barron, 2010) and a human information processing model (Mayer, 2001). With these models, all considerations for visual typology will be indicated in the implementation of visuals, learning design, visualization using virtual reality technologies and evaluation of visuals in multimedia development. Concluding the paper, meaningful connections between visuals and technological variables for developing multimedia project design will be considered. Indicators for learners and designers and teachers will be shown in learning imagery for visualization activity and educational technology. This will be followed by a discussion of the use of visuals and evaluation of visual materials based on the program of systematic evaluation developed by Dwyer (1972, 1978, 1987, 1994).

AB  - Spatial abilities (SAs) are cognitive resources used to mentally manipulate representations of objects to solve problems. Haptic abilities (HAs) represent tactile interactions with real-world objects transforming somatic information into mental representations. Both are proposed to be factors in anatomy education, yet relationships between SAs and HAs remain unknown. The objective of the current study was to explore SA-HA interactions. A haptic ability test (HAT) was developed based on the mental rotations test (MRT) with three-dimensional (3D) objects. The HAT was undertaken in three sensory conditions: (1) sighted, (2) sighted with haptics, and (3) haptics. Participants (n = 22; 13 females, 9 males) completed the MRT and were categorized into high spatial abilities (HSAs) (n = 12, mean +/- standard deviation: 13.7 +/- 3.0) and low spatial abilities (LSAs) (n = 10, 5.6 +/- 2.0) based on score distributions about the overall mean. Each SA group's HAT scores were compared across the three sensory conditions. Spearman's correlation coefficients between MRT and HAT scores indicated a statistically significant correlation in sighted condition (r = 0.553, p = 0.015) but were not significant in the sighted with haptics (r = 0.0.078, p = 0.212) and haptics (r = 0.043, p = 0.279) conditions. These data suggest HAs appear unrelated to SAs. With haptic exploration, LSA HAT scores were compensated; comparing HSA with LSA: sighted with haptics [median (lower and upper quartiles): 12 (12,13) vs. 12 (11,13), p = 0.254], and haptics [12 (11,13) vs. 12 (10,12), p = 0.381] conditions. Migrations to online anatomy teaching may unwittingly remove important sensory modalities from the learner. Understanding learner behaviors and performance when haptic inputs are removed from the learning environment represents valuable insight informing future anatomy curriculum and resource development.

AB  - Emotional creativity (EC), which constitutes a main aspect of the general creativity concept, is often shown to be substantially related to positive emotional experiences, effective motivation, and innovation at the workplace as well as at school. However, little is known about the relationship between emotional creativity and the time people tend to spend playing video games. Nowadays, video games and virtual reality have become an important aspect of public health and psychological research. They constitute a key element of popular culture and generate considerable economic profit as part of the public entertainment industry. Our study is based on the results of an emotional creativity inventory (ECI) survey that was administered at a snowball and convenient sample of 453 respondents (aged 18-60 years, M +/- SD: 23.68 +/- 6.36; 66.40% women, 20.00% with higher education) from the Czech Republic who were questioned about their habits and the time they devote to playing video games. The sample country was selected as one with a long tradition of homebrew video gaming going back to the 1980s. We employed a set of multinomial regression analyses, which revealed that more time devoted to playing video games is associated with lower emotional creativity, in general, as well as with lower novelty, preparedness, and effectiveness components of emotional creativity. The negative association above was less pronounced for women than for men. Moreover, in a sample containing only women, a longer time devoted to playing video games was associated with the higher novelty component of emotional creativity (the associations with the other two components were not statistically significant for women only). Our findings might considerably contribute to the study of the general overall long-term effect of video games and the use of digital technologies in general on public health.

AB  - Automatic assessment and evaluation of team performance during collaborative tasks is key to the research on learning analytics and computer-supported cooperative work. There is growing interest in the use of gaze-oriented cues for evaluating the collaboration and cooperativeness of teams. However, collecting gaze data using eye-trackers is not always feasible due to time and cost constraints. In this paper, we introduce an automated team assessment tool based on gaze points and joint visual attention (JVA) information drawn from computer vision solutions. We evaluated team collaborations in an undergraduate anatomy learning activity (N = 60, 30 teams) as a test user study. The results indicate that higher JVA was positively associated with student learning outcomes (r((30)) = 0.50, p < 0.005). Moreover, teams who participated in two experimental groups and used interactive 3D anatomy models, had higher JVA (F-(1,F-28) = 6.65, p < 0.05) and better knowledge retention (F-(1,F-28) = 7.56, p < 0.05) than those in the control group. Also, no significant difference was observed based on JVA for different gender compositions of teams. The findings from this work have implications in learning sciences and collaborative computing by providing a novel joint attention-based measure to objectively evaluate team collaboration dynamics.
   Implications for practice or policy:
   Student learning outcomes can be improved by receiving constructive feedback about team performances using our gaze-based collaborative learning method.
   Underrepresented and underserved minorities of science, technology, engineering and mathematics disciplines can be engaged in more collaborative problem-solving and team-based learning activities since our method offers a broader reach by automating collaboration assessment process.
   Course leaders can assess the quality of attention and engagement among students and can monitor or assist larger numbers of students simultaneously.

AB  - In recent years, the logistical challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic have prompted medical educators teaching gross anatomy to explore an expanded use of online instructional modalities. There is concern that this shift to online anatomy education in medical schools could affect long-term learning outcomes for future healthcare providers. In this systematic review, the educational effectiveness of online anatomy teaching is compared with traditional ("face-to-face") teaching methods, specifically in terms of students' academic performance and satisfaction. A search of four databases identified and screened 162 studies. Subsequently, 31 studies were analyzed, including both (a) teaching outcome measures (test scores) and (b) student satisfaction ratings. Authors chose studies, extracted data, assessed quality and examined risk of bias. Nineteen studies compared students' academic performances between online and face-to-face teaching methods. Twenty-six studies measured students' levels of satisfaction in both teaching methods. Both qualitative and quantitative analyses of the data revealed comparable academic performances with no statistical difference between the two teaching methods, but a higher level of satisfaction with face-to-face teaching. The findings confirm that students can learn from online teaching but are more satisfied with face-to-face teaching. The authors conclude that online teaching cannot replace traditional teaching and there is no preference for one type of modality over the other. Therefore, a multi-modal learning approach combining online with face-to-face educational modalities for medical students could be efficient and successful.

AB  - Background: Learning is a complex process involving internal cognitive processes and external stimuli from curricula, pedagogical strategies, and the learning environment. Theories are used extensively in higher edu-cation to understand the intricacies of adult learning and improve student outcomes. Nursing and midwifery education uses a range of technology enhanced learning (e-learning) approaches, some of which are underpinned by theoretical frameworks. Objective: Synthesise literature on theories that inform technology enhanced learning in nursing and midwifery education. Design: A systematic review. Data source: CINAHL, ERIC, MEDLINE and PubMed were searched for relevant studies (2000-2021). Reference lists of related literature reviews were hand searched. Review methods: Title and abstract, followed by full texts were screened by two reviewers independently using predefined eligibility criteria. Quality appraisal was not undertaken. Data were extracted and Merriam and Bierema's typology of adult learning theories used to categorise theories in each study. Results: Thirty-three studies were included, incorporating twenty-nine distinct learning theories from the behaviourist, cognitivist, constructivist, and social cognitivist domains, with constructivist being the most widely used. Kolb's Experiential Learning Theory and Driscoll's Constructivist Learning Theory were the most commonly reported theories. The population of learners were mainly undergraduate nursing students who used a range of online, mobile, blended or computerised learning, virtual reality, or digital forms of simulation, primarily in university settings. Theories were employed to inform the technology enhanced learning intervention or to help explain how these could improve student learning. Conclusion: This review highlighted a range of theories, particularly constructivist approaches, that underpin research on technology enhanced learning in nursing education, by informing or explaining how these digital interventions support learning. More rigorous research that examines the myriad of theoretical frameworks and their effectiveness in informing and explaining technology enhanced learning is needed to justify this approach to pedagogical nursing research and practice.

AB  - Background: Developing and maintaining a three-dimensional working knowledge of neuroanatomy is an essential skill in neurosurgery. However, conventional 2D head, neck, and neuroanatomy education is typically characterized by the separate rote learning of constituent tissues and often fails to provide learners with a contextual understanding of the relationships between these highly complex and interconnected structures. This can pose a significant challenge to medical students entering neurosurgery who lack a topographic understanding of intracranial anatomy. Methods: We report on the design and efficacy of a novel 6-part 3D surgical neuroanatomy pilot elective for medical students that utilized a navigation-based pedagogical technique with the goal of providing students with a framework for developing a 3D mental map of the skull base, neurovasculature, ventricular system, and associated brain regions. Students took on the perspective of physically traveling along the paths of key structures with a 360-degree view of surrounding anatomy such that they could appreciate the integration and relative spatial relationships of the varying tissues within the cranium. Mental navigation exercises and pre- and post-course surveys were used to assess students' baseline and learned familiarity with the different anatomical regions covered. Results: At the conclusion of the course, all students were able to successfully complete all of the multifaceted mental navigation exercises. Post-course survey data indicated that respondents perceived significant increases in their knowledge of cranial nerves; anterior, middle, and posterior skull base anatomy; anterior and posterior cranial circulation; and the ventricular system. Conclusion: 3D navigation-based fly-through instruction is a novel and effective technique for teaching complex anatomy and can provide learners with the foundational skills for developing and maintaining a 3D mental map of intracranial anatomy.

AB  - Background: Virtual learning environments (VLEs) were introduced to progress students from passive to active learners. Active learning promotes the critical thinking skills essential for the transfer/use of classroom-acquired knowledge into the clinical setting. A VLE forms an increasingly vital component of clinical skills development in a range of disciplines.
   Material and Methods: A randomized control trial was conducted with students randomly attending one of two teaching sessions about radiation therapy. Both sessions were identical except a VLE was used in the second talk with the first being solely didactic. Anonymous questionnaires were distributed. Two weeks after the talks, participants were required to complete the same knowledge questionnaire to determine retention. Mann-Whitney, means, standard deviations, and chi-squared tests were used according to data characteristics. Qualitative data (open-ended questions) were analysed thematically.
   Results: Virtual learning seemed to significantly improve students' satisfaction/engagement and recall. A total of 40 students attended the teaching sessions. The student group taught using the VLE had higher mean scores for retention than the didactic group; however, this was not statistically significant. Use of VLEs was associated with greater satisfaction/engagement than didactic information (P = .003). Students' learning styles seemed to have no effect on their satisfaction/engagement and ease of learning. Three key themes emerged from the qualitative data: (1) the visuals were good/helpful, (2) the talk was informative, and (3) more details/visuals were required.
   Discussion and Conclusion: The key findings from this study suggest that there is a role for VLEs in the teaching of students. There is a need for the introduction of advanced technology into health care education as virtual reality, such as Virtual Environment of Radiotherapy, has shown improvement in students' satisfaction, engagement, and recall. Whether VLEs qualify students better than conventional didactic teaching is still undetermined, but these first results are encouraging.

AB  - The development of digital strategies in teaching is based on the technological progress of the last decades, but also on the strong motivation to focus a didactic concept on the learning individuals. The available data of German medical faculties indicate that digital teaching concepts currently play a subordinate role in medicine in general and specifically in otorhinolaryngology. By assessing data of our own institution, we could demonstrate that the majority of medical students refer mainly to material handed out by the lecturers as single source of information for learning Otorhinolaryngology. Therefore, the application of sound digital teaching strategies provides special chances, in particular in otorhinolaryngology to cope with the excessive amount of online information from partly unclear sources.
   Currently, the possible degree of digital teaching reaches from digital service supply via punctual provision of classic teaching concepts and blended learning up to completely digital curricula. The attractiveness of curricular integration of digital teaching strategies is less based on the utilization of merely technological progress, but rather on the variety of applying innovative curricula and new didactic concepts. Depending on the intended teaching purpose, the flipped classroom and the virtual reality seem to have a particularly high potential, while mobile learning is already established in individual practice. Testing and evaluating digital teaching innovations for concrete scenarios currently belongs to the most important scientific challenges of digital teaching concepts.
   Today, the nationwide implementation of digital teaching in Germany is less impeded by technical conditions, but by missing financing because sponsoring is currently mainly performed with reference to concrete projects; in the context of permanent implementation, however, regular costs arise. To support these promising teaching concepts, the sponsoring of institutions for digital teaching with provision of hard-and software solutions at universities could contribute significantly. Establishing cooperation to use such digital platforms might lead to a high efficiency regarding the distribution with simultaneously profiting of savings potential.

TI  - Medical education in times of COVID-19: German students' expectations - A cross-sectional study
T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
KW  - GENERALIZED ANXIETY DISORDER
AB  - Background
   Since the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the education of medical students, medical faculties have faced the challenge of adapting instruction to digital platforms. Although medical students are willing to support pandemic response efforts, how the crisis will affect their medical training remains uncertain. Thus, in this study, we investigated the teaching- and learning-related stressors and expectations of medical students in Germany during the COVID-19 pandemic.
   Methods
   A cross-sectional survey was distributed online to undergraduate medical students at medical faculties in Germany. Students answered questions about COVID-19 and teaching (on a 7-point Likert scale from 0 ("not at all") to 6 ("completely")) and completed mental well-being measurements, including the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), the Generalised Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7) and the Perceived Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Descriptive data analysis, a t-test and Pearson correlations were performed to process the data.
   Results
   Medical students felt well-informed about COVID-19 in general (M = 5.64, SD = 1.28) and in the medical context (M = 5.14, SD = 1.34) but significantly less informed about the pandemic in the academic context, M = 2.47, SD = 1.49, t(371) = 31.98, p < .001. Their distress levels were high (STAI: M = 45.12, SD = 4.73) and significantly correlated with the academic context (r(p) = .164, p < .01) but not their private lives. Concerning how they were taught, they most often expected online lectures (91.7%) and live broadcasts (67.2%) and less often expected innovative digital teaching strategies, including serious games (17.3%) and virtual-reality exercises (16.7%).
   Discussion
   Medical students seem to be aware of the COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences for academic and healthcare contexts. They also seem to think that their teachers will enhance their digital competencies during the pandemic. Therefore, faculties of medicine need to rapidly and adequately digitalise their approaches to teaching.

AB  - The ongoing revolution in people's behavior, involving emphasized personal experiences, means that a product plays a decreasing role in competition, and creating an experience is becoming more important. This leads to new kinds of value chains and new kinds of networking, which will create challenges for companies. Cognitive infocomminacations (CogInfoCom) provide fast infocommunications links to extend our cognitive capabilities. Virtual technologies, such as virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR), will increase value creation by combining the strengths of humans and machines. The aim of this paper is to present an approach through which VR/AR with game programming tools can be utilized to boost business and enable new value creation in a world that is developing towards an experience economy. Our design methodology is based on agile innovation principles with fast experimentations that are carried out in co-creation with companies. The practical implementations are considered as multiple case studies. After introducing the current trends in VR/AR, we present our experiences of how these virtual technologies can be applied for CogInfoCom Aided Engineering tasks in various application fields. Despite the increasing popularity of virtual and augmented reality and game technologies, only a small amount of research has examined how they can be utilized professionally in the design processes of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). However, they provide effective tools for increasing user involvement in new product development and marketing. Based on the case studies, we present our experiences of how SMEs can benefit from virtual technologies by increasing their business agility and flexibility, reducing product design risk, shortening product development time, and enabling new business models. VR/AR technology with game programming proved to be effective tools for fast experimentation and co-creation with SMEs.

AB  - Purpose
   Globally, higher education has been, over the years, a source of innovation, policy, new knowledge and a national asset. However, the advent of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) is having an impact on the principles of learning from primary to tertiary levels. The purpose of this paper is to consider how the 4IR has and will continue to impact education at the various levels of learning.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The paper aims to bridge the perceived information gap and provide insights into the kinds of educational preparation and the skills and qualifications that 4IR jobs require. In response, the following are considered: the need to tweak the curriculum, adopt the right technology for in class and online delivery and the projection of other learning techniques and skills that are often not considered pertinent. Data gathering for the report was by discussion with experts and consultation of relevant articles and write-ups from related websites.
   Findings
   The advent of smart communication systems involving artificial intelligence, internet, robotics, virtual reality and digital textbooks has opened a new vista in relation to how and what is learnt in schools. Just as technologies brought about smart communication systems, the 4IR model of higher education is rapidly evolving and as such, curriculum development and review must be dynamic, and it must keep pace with the technological advances and skills required in the twenty first century.
   Originality/value
   The 4IR era will bring great changes to how students are taught and what students must learn as the tools for transformational learning are already overwhelming. Jobs will be scarce for those without the requisite skills, whereas those with the right skills will have to keep up with the pace of technological development, otherwise they too will be left behind. Schools will increasingly become centres for the generation of innovation and its incubation and in all this, quality learning, teaching and knowledge impartation can easily be carried out online.

AB  - Monoscopically projected three-dimensional (3D) visualization technology may have significant disadvantages for students with lower visual-spatial abilities despite its overall effectiveness in teaching anatomy. Previous research suggests that stereopsis may facilitate a better comprehension of anatomical knowledge. This study evaluated the educational effectiveness of stereoscopic augmented reality (AR) visualization and the modifying effect of visual-spatial abilities on learning. In a double-center randomized controlled trial, first- and second-year (bio)medical undergraduates studied lower limb anatomy with stereoscopic 3D AR model (n = 20), monoscopic 3D desktop model (n = 20), or two-dimensional (2D) anatomical atlas (n = 18). Visual-spatial abilities were tested with Mental Rotation Test (MRT), Paper Folding Test (PFT), and Mechanical Reasoning (MR) Test. Anatomical knowledge was assessed by the validated 30-item paper posttest. The overall posttest scores in the stereoscopic 3D AR group (47.8%) were similar to those in the monoscopic 3D desktop group (38.5%; P = 0.240) and the 2D anatomical atlas group (50.9%; P = 1.00). When stratified by visual-spatial abilities test scores, students with lower MRT scores achieved higher posttest scores in the stereoscopic 3D AR group (49.2%) as compared to the monoscopic 3D desktop group (33.4%; P = 0.015) and similar to the scores in the 2D group (46.4%; P = 0.99). Participants with higher MRT scores performed equally well in all conditions. It is instrumental to consider an aptitude-treatment interaction caused by visual-spatial abilities when designing research into 3D learning. Further research is needed to identify contributing features and the most effective way of introducing this technology into current educational programs.

AB  - This study evaluated effect of mental rotation (MR) training on learning outcomes and explored effectiveness of teaching via three-dimensional (3D) software among medical students with diverse spatial intelligence. Data from n = 67 student volunteers were included. A preliminary test was conducted to obtain baseline level of MR competency and was utilized to assign participants to two experimental conditions, i.e., trained group (n = 25) and untrained group (n = 42). Data on the effectiveness of training were collected to measure participants' speed and accuracy in performing various MR activities. Six weeks later, a large class format (LCF) session was conducted for all students using 3D software. The usefulness of technology-assisted learning at the LCF was evaluated via a pre- and post-test. Students' feedback regarding MR training and use of 3D software was acquired through questionnaires. MR scores of the trainees improved from 25.9 +/- 4.6 points to 28.1 +/- 4.4 (P = 0.011) while time taken to complete the tasks reduced from 20.9 +/- 3.9 to 12.2 +/- 4.4 minutes. Males scored higher than females in all components (P = 0.016). Further, higher pre- and post-test scores were observed in trained (9.0 +/- 1.9 and 12.3 +/- 1.6) versus untrained group (7.8 +/- 1.8; 10.8 +/- 1.8). Although mixed-design analysis of variance suggested significant difference in their test scores (P < 0.001), both groups reported similar trend in improvement by means of 3D software (P = 0.54). Ninety-seven percent of students reported technology-assisted learning as an effective means of instruction and found use of 3D software superior to plastic models. Software based on 3D technologies could be adopted as an effective teaching pedagogy to support learning across students with diverse levels of mental rotation abilities.

AB  - Aim: Using a comparison of digital teaching in medicine before and after the COVID-19 outbreak, the aim of the study was to examine how ad hoc digitization has changed (1) the design of digital teaching, (2) the attitudes toward and the capabilities of digital teaching and learning and (3) the future importance of individual digital teaching elements.
   Methods: Students and lecturers from the Medical Faculty of Ulm were asked to voluntarily participate in online surveys during the summer semesters of 2019 and 2020. The data was subsequently analyzed from a longitudinal and cross-sectional view descriptively as well as by using t-tests and Chi2-tests. In addition, using regression analyses, the results were controlled for associations with age, study progress, and media affinity.
   Results: In the summer semester 2019, 163 students (6.1% response rate) and 56 lecturers (11.5%) participated in the surveys. In the following year, the participation increased to 285 students (10.4%) and 64 lecturers (12.8%). Video-based teaching elements such as videoconferencing and lecture recordings were increasingly used after the COVID-19 outbreak and considered more significant for future teaching. In contrast, virtual reality, augmented reality and 360 degrees-videos, grouped under the term extended reality (XR), are descriptively becoming less important. Most lecturers would like to teach more digitally even after the pandemic but fear a decrease in learning effectiveness and contact with students, who tend to prefer asynchronous learning opportunities.
   Conclusion: Video-based teaching elements proved to be a low-threshold and time-efficient solution during the lockdown and were also recommended for future use. The XR technology has been put on the back burner for the time being, but in view of the increased digital teaching motivation and capabilities, it can be assumed that lecturers will recognize and use the potential of XR as soon as they have the freedom to design innovative teaching again.

AB  - The employment of modern technologies is widespread in our society, so the inclusion of practical activities for education has become essential and useful at the same time. These activities are more noticeable in Engineering, in areas such as cybersecurity, data science, artificial intelligence, etc. Additionally, these activities acquire even more relevance with a distance education methodology, as our case is. The inclusion of these practical activities has clear advantages, such as (1) promoting critical thinking and (2) improving students' abilities and skills for their professional careers. There are several options, such as the use of remote and virtual laboratories, virtual reality and game-based platforms, among others. This work addresses the development of a new cloud game-based educational platform, which defines a modular and flexible architecture (using light containers). This architecture provides interactive and monitoring services and data storage in a transparent way. The platform uses gamification to integrate the game as part of the instructional process. The CyberScratch project is a particular implementation of this architecture focused on cybersecurity game-based activities. The data privacy management is a critical issue for these kinds of platforms, so the architecture is designed with this feature integrated in the platform components. To achieve this goal, we first focus on all the privacy aspects for the data generated by our cloud game-based platform, by considering the European legal context for data privacy following GDPR and ISO/IEC TR 20748-1:2016 recommendations for Learning Analytics (LA). Our second objective is to provide implementation guidelines for efficient data privacy management for our cloud game-based educative platform. All these contributions are not found in current related works. The CyberScratch project, which was approved by UNED for the year 2020, considers using the xAPI standard for data handling and services for the game editor, game engine and game monitor modules of CyberScratch. Therefore, apart from considering GDPR privacy and LA recommendations, our cloud game-based architecture covers all phases from game creation to the final users' interactions with the game.

AB  - This paper presents the Usability assessment of the Earth Course Large-Scale Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL) STEM education pilot, which is part of the European Horizon 2020 NEWTON project (www.newtonproject.eu). The pilot was carried out in two single-gender primary schools from Dublin, Ireland, where boys only participated in the first school and girls only in the second. Two experimental classes participated in each school. One group used the NEWTON-based lessons as an introduction to a topic (classes A with 30 boys and A' with 30 girls). The other group used the NEWTON-based lessons as revision on to the same topic, as they had previously covered the same content with their usual teacher 4 to 10 weeks earlier (classes B with 30 boys and B' with 27 girls). The Earth Course Large-Scale Pilot (LSP) includes a set of educational applications, developed as part of the NEWTON project in an effort to attract students to STEM subjects, which cover a set of topics within four main areas: Atmosphere, Geosphere, Biosphere and Astronomy. This paper reports the results of the usability evaluation for both schools. The majority of the participating students found the NEWTON-based lessons useful, particularly in classes that used it as an introductory tool. A comparison in usability between employing the NEWTON applications as introductory tools as opposed to revision tools was carried out for each school and grouping, showing that the classes participating in introductory NEWTON-based lessons provided higher usability scores compared to students participating in revision NEWTON-based lessons. It was also observed that the two boys' classes were much more open to using NEWTON-based lessons when learning, with the lowest scores received from the girls in experimental class B'. It was also reported by students, mainly in classes that used NEWTON-based lessons for revision, that they see it as a supporting tool for their teachers.

KW  - integration implementing smart connection Seven Habits
AB  - Teaching primary students has various challenges and specific demands. Pupils tend to find it difficult to implement the things they learn in class. This issue indicates that many of the classes simply go to waste or are meaningless to the student. As educators, we must build a strong foundation in various subjects in order to avoid problematic issues with no or very little solution in the future.
   We managed to create a new concept that will improve the educational methods conducted in the Middle East. This was done by adopting new tools for measuring learning outcomes.
   The integration of various subjects into our day to day lives enriches, adds value, creates variety and makes a smart connection between subjects and learning fields. It can change the criteria and the standards of little learners.
   1 In our integration lessons; we have implemented the combination of science, English, math, "The Seven Habits" and religion altogether to try and capture as well as engage the pupils in active discussions in order to in cooperate the different roles of each subject in society.
   2 Learners are engaged in several different ways such as telling them short stories, showing them a sketch or perhaps even a statement that would connect them to real-life scenarios in order to achieve the particular outcomes
   3 In these studies "The Seven Habits" are adopted and implemented in all sessions for making leaders and project team members more active. For example, Habit 3 states, "Put first things first" and Habit two states, "Begin with the end in mind." The two were highly effective in following scientific methods.
   4 We examined different methods and strategies that could be used to add value to the sessions and enrich the imagination of the young learners. Such strategies and methods include the use of virtual reality to combine some form of technology. When integration is applied to lessons, students will surely be more interested in the subjects they are studying. Integration makes learning more fun and surely creates meaning for each subject. It is also a creative way to engage students in active learning.

AB  - Purpose The anatomy of both the brain and the skull is particularly difficult to learn and to teach. Since their anatomical structures are numerous and gathered in a complex tridimensional (3D) architecture, classic schematical drawing or photography in two dimensions (2D) has difficulties in providing a clear, simple, and accurate message. Advances in photography and computer sciences have led to develop stereoscopic 3D visualization, firstly for entertainment then for education. In the present study, we report our experience of stereoscopic 3D lecture for neuroanatomy teaching to early medical school students. Methods High-resolution specific pictures were taken on various specimen dissections in the Anatomy Laboratory of the University of Lyon, France. Selected stereoscopic 3D views were displayed on a large dedicated screen using a doubled video projector. A 2-h stereoscopic neuroanatomy lecture was given by two neuroanatomists to third-year medicine students who wore passive 3D glasses. Setting up lasted 30 min and involved four people. The feedback from students was collected and analyzed. Results Among the 483 students who have attended the stereoscopic 3D lecture, 195 gave feedback, and all (100%) were satisfied. Among these, 190 (97.5%) reported a better knowledge transfer of brain anatomy and its 3D architecture. Furthermore, 167 (86.1%) students felt it could change their further clinical practice, 179 (91.8%) thought it could enhance their results in forthcoming anatomy examinations, and 150 (76.9%) believed such a 3D lecture might allow them to become better physicians. This 3D anatomy lecture was graded 8.9/10 a mean against 5.9/10 for previous classical 2D lectures. Discussion-conclusion The stereoscopic 3D teaching of neuroanatomy made medical students enthusiastic involving digital technologies. It could improve their anatomical knowledge and test scores, as well as their clinical competences. Depending on university means and the commitment of teachers, this new tool should be extended to other anatomical fields. However, its setting up requires resources from faculties and its impact on clinical competencies needs to be objectively assessed.

AB  - Medical schools are substituting anatomy dissection with various supplemental learning techniques such as virtual and augmented reality. Most studies focus on the knowledge of anatomy content as an outcome measure without evidence of clinical anatomical conceptual knowledge, engagement in group learning, or social development. Despite having no absolute standard method of learning or teaching anatomy, especially considering today's modern era of disruptive medical innovations and technology, there have been reports of successful teaching using problem-based learning. In our medical school, we present the anatomy lab experience in a balanced multimodal integrated approach using plastinated cadaveric materials supported by clinical cases, quizzes, virtual reality, imaging, ultrasound (US) experience, and dissection videos, all presented in a team-based learning environment.
   During the "Structural Integrity of Human Body" (MSK) course, six anatomy lab sessions were created consisting of clinically integrated topics. Students were divided into three groups, each consisting of four students. Each lab session contained multiple stations utilizing a different form of a learning experience. Students' perceptions and comments about these learning experiences were collected during the end of course evaluations and an exclusive anatomy lab survey.
   More than 90% of students agreed that the integrated anatomy labs enhanced their learning experience. However, the exclusive imaging experience was rated lower. 64% of students agreed that hands-on ultrasound had improved their learning experience. The dissection video watching station was rated very low. The students' perception survey revealed that students learned more while working in teams than being led by the faculty. Data on the students' work-life balance was favorable and within the national standards. The students' engagement and effectiveness were assessed by their lab quizzes, lab attendance, and grades in the lab practical exam.
   Multimodal clinical teaching in anatomy lab provided students with conceptual knowledge of integrated disciplines and elaborated their understating of contextual clinical-anatomical concepts. The relaxed, active learning lab environment helped students to work efficiently within their teams and improve their social interaction.

AB  - Background: The ability of nursing undergraduates to communicate effectively with health care providers, patients, and their family members is crucial to their nursing professions as these can affect patient outcomes. However, the traditional use of didactic lectures for communication skills training is ineffective, and the use of standardized patients is not time- or cost-effective. Given the abilities of virtual patients (VPs) to simulate interactive and authentic clinical scenarios in secured environments with unlimited training attempts, a virtual counseling application is an ideal platform for nursing students to hone their communication skills before their clinical postings.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to develop and test the use of VPs to better prepare nursing undergraduates for communicating with real-life patients, their family members, and other health care professionals during their clinical postings.
   Methods: The stages of the creation of VPs included preparation, design, and development, followed by a testing phase before the official implementation. An initial voice chatbot was trained using a natural language processing engine, Google Cloud's Dialogflow, and was later visualized into a three-dimensional (3D) avatar form using Unity 3D.
   Results: The VPs included four case scenarios that were congruent with the nursing undergraduates' semesters' learning objectives: (1) assessing the pain experienced by a pregnant woman, (2) taking the history of a depressed patient, (3) escalating a bleeding episode of a postoperative patient to a physician, and (4) showing empathy to a stressed-out fellow final-year nursing student. Challenges arose in terms of content development, technological limitations, and expectations management, which can be resolved by contingency planning, open communication, constant program updates, refinement, and training.
   Conclusions: The creation of VPs to assist in nursing students' communication skills training may provide authentic learning environments that enhance students' perceived self-efficacy and confidence in effective communication skills. However, given the infancy stage of this project, further refinement and constant enhancements are needed to train the VPs to simulate real-life conversations before the official implementation.

AB  - Teacher feedback provided to learners in real-time is a crucial factor for their knowledge and skills acquisition. However, providing real-time feedback at an individual level is often infeasible, considering limited teaching resources. Fortunately, recent technological advancements have allowed for developing of various computer tutoring systems, which can support learners at any place and time by generating personalized feedback automatically. Such systems have emerged in various domains, tackle different educational tasks, and often are designed in very distinctive ways. Consequently, the knowledge in the field of automated feedback systems is rather scattered across different domains and applications, as we illustrate in this study. This paper aims to outline the state-of-the-art of recently developed systems for delivering automated feedback, and thus serves as a source of systematic information for educators, researchers in the educational domain and system developers. More specifically, the contribution of this study is twofold. Firstly, we offer an extensive literature review of the field. As a result of a rigorous selection process, consisting of 4 phases, a total of 109 automated feedback systems is selected for a detailed review and thoroughly classified against numerous dimensions. Secondly, based on a detailed analysis of the recent literature sources and following the design science research approach, a classification framework for automated feedback systems is developed. This framework is used to classify the selected systems, and thus give a detailed overview of the predominantly available educational technologies, the educational settings in which they are applied, the properties of automated feedback they deliver, and the approaches for their design and evaluation. Based on this analysis, several important observations and recommendations are put forward as an outcome of the study. In particular, our study outlines the current fragmentation of the field, discusses a need for a common reference framework, and calls for more personalized, data-driven and student-centered solutions to exploit a larger set of opportunities offered in this age of data.

AB  - Background: The use of digital education in problem-based learning, or digital problem-based learning (DPBL), is increasingly employed in health professions education. DPBL includes purely digitally delivered as well as blended problem-based learning, wherein digital and face-to-face learning are combined.
   Objective: The aim of this review is to evaluate the effectiveness of DPBL in improving health professionals' knowledge, skills, attitudes, and satisfaction.
   Methods: We used the gold-standard Cochrane methods to conduct a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). We included studies that compared the effectiveness of DPBL with traditional learning methods or other forms of digital education in improving health professionals' knowledge, skills, attitudes, and satisfaction. Two authors independently screened studies, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. We contacted study authors for additional information, if necessary. We used the random-effects model in the meta-analyses.
   Results: Nine RCTs involving 890 preregistration health professionals were included. Digital technology was mostly employed for presentation of problems. In three studies, PBL was delivered fully online. Digital technology modalities spanned online learning, offline learning, virtual reality, and virtual patients. The control groups consisted of traditional PBL and traditional learning. The pooled analysis of seven studies comparing the effect of DPBL and traditional PBL reported little or no difference in postintervention knowledge outcomes (standardized mean difference [SMD] 0.19, 95% CI 0.00-0.38). The pooled analysis of three studies comparing the effect of DPBL to traditional learning on postintervention knowledge outcomes favored DPBL (SMD 0.67, 95% CI 0.14-1.19). For skill development, the pooled analysis of two studies comparing DPBL to traditional PBL favored DPBL (SMD 0.30, 95% CI 0.07-0.54). Findings on attitudes and satisfaction outcomes were mixed. The included studies mostly had an unclear risk of bias.
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest that DPBL is as effective as traditional PBL and more effective than traditional learning in improving knowledge. DPBL may be more effective than traditional learning or traditional PBL in improving skills. Further studies should evaluate the use of digital technology for the delivery of other PBL components as well as PBL overall.

AB  - Introduction: Physical models are being used in embryology lectures along with PowerPoint presentations to improve the spatial orientation of students. But the demonstration of the sequence of changes is not possible with commercial models due to nonavailability and high expenses. The latest audio-visual aids including three-dimensional projections like simulation-based screens, or virtual reality enhance the visual-spatial ability of the students but are very costly and not affordable for all institutions. Aim: To compare the effectiveness of hand-made physical models with the PowerPoint presentation mode of teaching in understanding the 3D concept of embryology, among first-year MBBS students and to assess the students' perception of this model-based teaching. Materials and Methods: The study was conducted using a quasi-experimental study design, on 218 phase 1 medical students of Government Medical College, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India, from February 2020 to August 2020. The students were divided into two equal groups. Group B was taught the topic "Second week of embryonic life " with a PowerPoint lecture session (n=109) and the Group A had in addition a demonstration with the handmade models (n=109). Pretest and post-test were conducted with an internally validated questionnaire. Feedback on the student's acceptance of teaching/ learning with models were also collected. The improvement of the test scores was analysed using paired t-tests in both the test and control groups.Results: Statistically significant improvement in knowledge score was obtained while comparing the post-test scores of the intervention group (mean score was 4.83 +/- 2) with that of the non intervention group (mean score was 3.99 +/- 2.06) (student's t-test, p-value < 0.05). It was observed, 99.1% of students were satisfied with this model-assisted teaching, especially with the series of models demonstrating the sequence of events. A 93.1% of students said that they needed such model-assisted lectures in other subjects also.Conclusion: Series of models pertaining to a particular event is beneficial and effective for learning complex concepts of embryology. Also, it's a long-lasting, innovative mode of teaching which can be done cost-effectively.

AB  - Introduction: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has necessitated closure of physical classroom for maintaining social distancing norms, prompting learning environment to shift from offline to online. Medical education has also undergone similar changes, and online education and assessment methods had to be implemented. Student's perception regarding the same was assessed through this study.
   Aim: To assess the perception of first year MBBS students about the online education and assessment during the lockdown period of two months.
   Materials and Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out on the first year MBBS students of North Bengal Medical College (NBMCH) during the COVID-19 Lockdown period. All first year MBBS students of NBMCH were added in WhatsApp groups created for academic purposes by Department of Anatomy, NBMCH during the lockdown period. Respective teachers in the academic groups carried out sharing of Digital Education Material (DEM), holding Online Interaction (OI) and correspondence with students, and taking Online Assessments (OA) through sharing questions framed in Google Forms. After two months, the perception of the students was assessed through a voluntary participation based online survey designed in google forms, the results of which were tabulated later and analysed.
   Results: A total 95 students (54 Male, 41 Female) out of 200 had participated in the survey. Most students were reliant on smartphones (n=90, 94.7%) and mobile internet (n=78, 82%). Most agreed on DEM being relevant (83.2%) and informative (80.7%) but showed diverging opinion on ease of understanding, revision and overall fulfillment of learning objective. On OI majority students responded positively on promptness, relevancy, informative and helpfulness but only 46.8% considered DEM and OI fulfilled the overall learning objective. Regarding OA students had an overall positive opinion. Comparing the online mode with offline, students mostly preferred the latter, though agreeing that online method of education was effective and it was easier to score in OAs.
   Conclusion: While most students accepted online education, interaction and assessment positively, at the end most of them still preferred offline mode of education and assessment. This could reflect lack of student-student interaction and indicated need of further studies to explore the matter, to help us approach online education better.

KW  - informatization of self-education
AB  - The article substantiates that large-scale implementation of information technologies will facilitate methodological support of future foreign language teachers' linguistic self-education.
   The main functions and advantages of the author's multimedia training package "English for Self-Education", designed to support future foreign language teachers' linguistic self-educational activities, are characterized. It is defined that the package is an open-ended multipurpose programmatic learning system, containing didactic, methodological, informational and reference materials. The package is based on general pedagogical, ergonomic and specific principles of informatization of education.
   It has a dual structure, which includes two levels. The first level contains 1) lexical-informational component that provides working with lexical and theoretical material, 2) training element, which enables practicing knowledge and skills, as well as mastering methods and means of autonomous managing, regulating and correcting the process of linguistic self-education, 3) control aspect, which allows realizing independent monitoring and evaluating the degree and quality of acquired knowledge and skills. The second level considerably extends didactic possibilities and educational resources of the package. It covers a wide range of extra learning materials of theoretical and practical nature that are available both in the package itself and beyond its limits through providing the access to the "virtual reality" within external resources of global network. All the above not only makes for activating students' cognitive activity but also significantly enriches their language and sociocultural practice.
   The package enables comprehensive independent study of a foreign language, exercising self-diagnostics in order to detect gaps in the student's foreign-language competence, performing intensive linguistic self-educational activities, constant monitoring the level of autonomously mastered foreign-language material, carrying out search for information, etc.
   Thus, the package provides optimal conditions for future foreign language teachers' linguistic self-educational activities. Students have an opportunity to actualize the adaptive algorithm of building the individual trajectory of linguistic self-education in accordance with their psychological features and personal educational needs.
   It is shown that working with the package results in students' receiving an external and internal educational products, namely improving foreign-language knowledge and skills, along with gaining personal experience of linguistic self-educational activities.
   It is grounded by the example of the proposed package that comprehensive use of IT significantly optimizes the process of linguistic self-education.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Despite the fact that there are currently many humane teaching methods available, harmful animal use in education and training remains widespread among life and health sciences disciplines. The use of humane teaching methods instead is based not only on legal, ethical, and economic factors, but also on evidence that these training techniques are just as efficient or even better in improving knowledge, understanding, and clinical or surgical skills proficiency among students. However, studies systematically comparing the learning outcomes of both harmful animal use and humane teaching methods are more than a decade old, and the evidence needs to be updated. Here, we assess and summarize the currently available studies through the process of a systematic review. We found 50 relevant studies and established that in 90% of studies humane teaching methods were as or more effective than harmful animal use in achieving desired learning outcomes. These results are clear-there is no valid educational reason for continued harmful animal use in education and training.
   Humane alternatives to harmful educational animal use include ethically-sourced cadavers, models, mannequins, mechanical simulators, videos, computer and virtual reality simulations, and supervised clinical and surgical experiences. In many life and health sciences courses, however, traditional animal use persists, often due to uncertainty about the educational efficacy of humane alternatives. The most recent comprehensive reviews assessing learning outcomes of humane teaching methods, in comparison to harmful animal use, were published more than 10 years ago. Therefore, we aimed to collate and analyse the combined evidence from recent and older studies about the efficacy of humane teaching methods. Using specific search terms, we systematically searched the Web of Science, SCOPUS, and EMBASE databases for relevant educational studies. We extracted information on publication years, the country in which the study was conducted, field, humane teaching methods, form of learning outcome assessment, and the learning outcome of the humane teaching methods, in comparison with harmful animal use. We found 50 relevant studies published from 1968-2020, primarily stemming from the USA, UK, and Canada. Humane teaching methods produced learning outcomes superior (30%), equivalent (60%), or inferior (10%) to those produced by traditional harmful animal use. In conclusion, a wide-spread implementation of humane teaching methods would not only preserve learning outcomes, but may in fact be beneficial for animals, students, educators, and institutions.

AB  - Background: Virtual patients are interactive computer-based simulations that are being increasingly used in modern health care education. They have been identified as tools that can provide experiential learning and assessment in a standardized and safe environment. However, the study of high-fidelity virtual patients such as interactive clinical avatars within pharmacy is limited.
   Objective: The aim of this paper is to describe the design and review of three interactive clinical avatar simulations as part of pharmacist preregistration training.
   Methods: A multistep design approach was taken to create interactive clinical avatar simulations on the topics of emergency hormonal contraception (EHC), calculation of renal function, and childhood illnesses. All case studies were reviewed by registered pharmacists to establish content and face validity. The EHC case study and data collection questionnaire were also reviewed by a purposive sample of preregistration trainees and newly qualified pharmacists. The questionnaire used Likert ranking statements and open-ended questions to obtain users' feedback on the design, usability, and usefulness of the interactive clinical avatars as learning tools. Descriptive statistics and content analysis were undertaken on the data. Results: Ten preregistration trainees and newly qualified pharmacists reviewed the EHC interactive clinical avatars and data collection questionnaire. The data collection questionnaire was associated with a Cronbach alpha=.95, demonstrating good reliability. All three interactive clinical avatar simulations were reported as usable and appropriately designed for preregistration training. Users perceived they were developing skills and knowledge from the simulations. The high-fidelity nature of the avatars and relevance of the simulations to real-life practice were reported as aspects that encouraged the application of theory to practice. Improvements were suggested to ensure the simulations were more user-friendly.
   Conclusions: The design and creation of the interactive clinical avatar simulations was successful. The multistep review process ensured validity and reliability of the simulations and data collection questionnaire. The in-depth explanation of the design process and provision of a questionnaire may help widen the use and evaluation of interactive clinical avatars or other simulation tools in pharmacy education. The interactive clinical avatars were reported as novel learning tools that promoted experiential learning and allowed users to feel like they were engaging in real-life scenarios, thus developing transferable knowledge and skills. This may be potentially beneficial for many health care training courses as a way to provide standardized experiences promoting active learning and reflection.

AB  - Aim/Purpose This research proposed a 3D multiuser virtual learning environment (3DMUVLE) educational game design framework by combining ATMSG, ADDIE, E-Simulation, and 3D Open Simulator Technology Architecture. This paper focused on a case study of online training for food crops productivity data surveys.
   Background The conventional online training still lacks engagement, immersion, and curiosity aspects, which decreases learners' learning seriousness because the instructors and participants do not meet directly. Integration of 3DMUVLE and gamification in online training has a good potential to tackle the issue.
   Methodology This research applied the Design Research Method (DRM) to propose a 3DMUVLE educational game design framework. The proposed framework was applied in training that involved 30 participants (first group), and the result was compared with that of 30 other participants (second group) who studied using the conventional method, which was an e-book and web-based learning. Authors compared the perceived usefulness and heightened enjoyment in using the proposed 3DMUVLE using linear regression analysis on HMSAM model.
   Contribution Through statistical tests on the case study data, this research indicated that the 3DMUVLE resulted in better knowledge gain.
   Findings Some important findings in this paper include (1) the development steps of a 3DMUVLE educational game design framework for online training of food crops productivity data survey; (2) statistical analysis result that the proposed 3DMUVLE lead to better knowledge gain, enjoyment, curiosity, immersion, and usefulness aspects; (3) the statistical analytic also showed that enjoyment and perceived of usefulness factors represented the strongest variables that influenced behavioral intention to use.
   Recommendations for Practitioners The 3DMUVLE is suggested to produce better knowledge gain, yet it still has to be proven further through similar statistical analysis in real field survey scenarios.
   Recommendations for Researchers The proposed 3DMUVLE can be adapted to other domains. Pleasing features in the game can be improved, such as quality of instruction in the simulation, in the hope that these will increase engagement and knowledge gain. Voice communication among users and instructors to improve interactivity may also be introduced.
   Impact on Society 3DMUVLE potentially offers better knowledge gain that can be applied in various fields of online training.
   Future Research An immediate future research includes a development targeted for smartphone platform, in Virtual Reality (VR) or non-VR mode. VR improves immersion aspect further but is more complicated to perform. Smartphone is relatively cheaper than a computer and more accessible by more people. Training using a smartphone-based 3DMUVLE can be carried out in wider scenarios.

AB  - As the latest and hottest concept in the international arena, the metaverse concept has attracted the attention of various industries including information, economy, art, management, education and teaching for its application and technology integration research, but whether to define metaverse as a technology or a scenario has not yet reached a unified understanding in the academic and scientific communities. We believe that metaverse should be used as a key concept and emerging theory in building the future intelligent field. Therefore, we introduce the concept of metaverse in future film and animation teaching as a novel, strategic and disruptive teaching field with great potential, and the constructed metaverse self-directed learning field will become an important part of school education resource optimization. In this study, we focus on the quality improvement path of film and animation teaching in the context of metaverse, and conduct a study on the assessment method of teaching quality after the introduction of metaverse concept. Specifically, we discuss the quality improvement measures in the future teaching of film and animation, construct a teaching field of film and animation based on the metaverse, and propose a related teaching quality assessment model and establish an index system for the quality assessment of film and animation teaching in the context of the metaverse. The index system is composed of 3 primary indicators, 9 secondary indicators and 27 tertiary indicators, and the quantitative calculation is carried out by the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) in fuzzy mathematics, and the weighting results of the indicators are calculated. The research goal of combining quantitative analysis and qualitative research was achieved. What can be seen through our research is that the metaverse online classroom built with virtual reality and other technologies will have more advantages than the traditional teaching classroom. In the future, similar learning devices can be introduced in film and animation teaching, and diversified learning modules can be established. Not only can the learning efficiency of offline classroom be improved, but also more learning space can be opened for online classroom. This study bridges the gap in the theory of quality assessment of film and animation teaching after the introduction of the future metaverse concept, innovates the analysis of the new concept and the improvement of the old method, builds a new scenario of organic combination of new technology and traditional education teaching, and provides a new idea for international and domestic future education research.

AB  - Currently, one of the key processes in the higher education is the "transition to a digital platform", i.e. the development and adoption of digital technologies, solutions and products in the educational process. In the future, several clusters of digital technology in the higher education will be deployed on the basis of data analytics, digital models, artificial intelligence, augmented and virtual reality, and the blockchain.
   The study addresses the following objectives: 1) development of a structured "map" of digital technology for higher education; 2) assessment of the extent of development and use of digital technologies in the higher education sphere at present (in developed countries and in a separate region of the Russian Federation - Krasnoyarsk Krai); 3) assessment of the prospects for the development and adoption of digital technologies by 2035 (in developed countries and in Krasnoyarsk Krai).
   The following research methods were used: 1) a conceptual analysis of scientific publications, forecasts, foresight-studies and analytical reports; 2) expert interviews, 3) a questionnaire based survey (32 experts - researchers, professors, representatives of government and consulting companies).
   The following core groups of digital technologies are designated: 1) digital solutions for defining the personal goals of education, educational navigation, building a project for an individual educational trajectory; 2) adaptive educational environment for the implementation of an individual educational trajectory; 3) digital solutions for learning activities support; monitoring the results of education; solutions for educational logistics; 4) digital solutions for assessment and certification (personal identification and competency assessment); 5) digital solutions for career support and lifelong education; 6) digital solutions for building and supporting university communities (including teachers, students, graduates, university partners); 7) digital solutions for monitoring and modeling the dynamics of competences at the population level. Each group includes 3-12 technologies, so it is possible to build a detailed "map" of digital technologies for higher education sphere.
   According to the experts, most of the major groups of digital technologies for education are currently (2018) in the stage of "working prototypes and pilot products" and "locally used products" (in the developed countries of the world). The exceptions are "digital solutions for monitoring and modeling the dynamics of competencies at the population level," which are still at the "research and development" stage. By 2030, all technologies of major groups will reach the stage of "mass market products" and "local market products".
   The structure of assessments of the digital technology application in the present and prospects for adoption by 2030 for Krasnoyarsk Krai is generally similar to the structure of assessments for developed countries of the world, but the magnitudes of the estimates are much smaller. The result reflects the "catching up" nature of the development of digital technology in the education sphere in the region. The basic strategy of digitalization of higher education in the region will be the transfer of ready-made solutions that have already found wide application in the developed countries of the world.

AB  - Background: Reducing childhood morbidity and mortality is challenging, particularly in countries with a shortage of qualified health care workers. Lack of trainers makes it difficult to provide the necessary continuing education in pediatrics for postregistration health professionals. Digital education, teaching and learning by means of digital technologies, has the potential to deliver medical education to a large audience while limiting the number of trainers needed.
   Objective: The goal of the research was to evaluate whether digital education can replace traditional learning to improve postregistration health professionals' knowledge, skills, attitudes, and satisfaction and foster behavior change in the field of pediatrics.
   Methods: We completed a systematic review of the literature by following the Cochrane methodology. We searched 7 major electronic databases for articles published from January 1990 to August 2017. No language restrictions were applied. We independently selected studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias, and pairs of authors compared information. We contacted authors of studies for additional information if necessary. All pooled analyses were based on random effects models. We included individually or cluster randomized controlled trials that compared digital education with traditional learning, no intervention, or other forms of digital education. We assessed the quality of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) criteria.
   Results: Twenty studies (1382 participants) were included. Participants included pediatricians, physicians, nurses, and midwives. Digital education technologies were assessed including high-fidelity mannequins (6 studies), computer-based education (12 studies), mobile learning (1 study), and virtual reality (1 study). Most studies reported that digital education was either as effective as or more effective than the control intervention for outcomes including skill, knowledge, attitude, and satisfaction. High-fidelity mannequins were associated with higher postintervention skill scores compared with low-fidelity mannequins (standardized mean difference 0.62; 95% CI 0.17-1.06; moderate effect size, low-quality evidence). One study reported physician change in practicing behavior and found similar effects between offline plus online digital education and no intervention. The only study that assessed impact on patient outcome found no difference between intervention and control groups. None of the included studies reported adverse or untoward effects or economic outcomes of the digital education interventions. The risk of bias was mainly unclear or high. The quality of evidence was low due to study inconsistencies, limitations, or imprecision across the studies.
   Conclusions: Digital education for postregistration health professions education in pediatrics is at least as effective as traditional learning and more effective than no learning. High-fidelity mannequins were found to be more effective at improving skills than traditional learning with low-fidelity mannequins. Computer-based offline/online digital education was better than no intervention for knowledge and skill outcomes and as good as traditional face-to-face learning. This review highlights evidence gaps calling for more methodologically rigorous randomized controlled trials on the topic.

AB  - The use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has brought a revolution in the teaching learning process. The current generation of students (Generation Z) have had access to the Internet, computers, smartphones and/or other such devices, since their early childhood. In general, these students, in contrast to older generations, are at the forefront of adopting new technologies. Therefore, both an evolution and a revolution in the classroom environment are required. In ICT, Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) play an increasingly important role in teaching. AR is the view of a physical real-world environment through a device (smartphone, tablet, etc.) including images, video and audio. In this way, it is possible to offer an enhanced version of reality using technology, whereas VR is the use of computer technology to create a simulated environment. AR does not replace physical reality; it keeps the real world central, but enhances it with multimedia elements.
   There are different types of AR technology, such as Quick Response codes (QR codes). QR codes are two-dimensional bar codes that can be scanned with smart devices using free QR reader software. The codes can be linked to content created by an instructor or to a website. QR codes have become widely popular; nevertheless, in spite of their apparent popularity, their implementation in higher education is underexplored.
   We present herein the results obtained in two subjects from the Pharmacy degree, Pharmaceutical Botany and Organic Chemistry, in which we used a blended learning strategy, combining two teaching approaches, traditional learning and QR codes. In Organic Chemistry, the teaching-learning activity was performed in practical laboratory classes, where the groups are small and a closer follow-up can be carried out. QR codes of different experimental procedures were included in the lab handouts. The codes gave access, through mobile devices, to videos explaining the experimental techniques. In Pharmaceutical Botany, it consisted in the development of a field guidebook using QR codes that link with a short video about vegetation and landscape of specific transects to illustrate a particular pattern along which communities of plants change. Such videos were recorded by student volunteers during the trips throughout the academic year. The teaching material produced in the field study sites was shared with fellow students. Additionally, electronic copies containing QR codes of both organic chemistry lab handouts and the field guidebook were uploaded to the university virtual campus. The readiness and use of QR codes and smartphones were evaluated during the practical sessions and workshops, and the students were able to provide feedback through completion of a questionnaire. Overall, student evaluations showed encouraging results.
   In conclusion, QR codes were shown to be a useful tool to enable easy access for students to online information as well as enhancing the learning experience by using visually appealing interactive content. The study provided a good basis for QR code implementation as a valuable innovative educational resource in combination with traditional teaching.

AB  - Background: Digital education is "the act of teaching and learning by means of digital technologies." Digital education comprises a wide range of interventions that can be broadly divided into offline digital education, online digital education, digital game-based learning, massive open online courses (MOOCs), psychomotor skills trainers, virtual reality environments, virtual patient simulations, and m-learning. Chronic wounds pose an immense economic and psychosocial burden to patients and the health care system, as caring for them require highly specialized personnel. Current training strategies face significant barriers, such as lack of time due to work commitments, distance from provider centers, and costs. Therefore, there is an increased need to synthesize evidence on the effectiveness of digital education interventions on chronic wounds management in health care professionals.
   Objective: Our main objective is to assess the effectiveness of digital education as a stand-alone approach or as part of a blended-learning approach in improving pre- and postregistration health care professionals' knowledge, attitudes, practical skills, and behavior in the management of chronic wounds, as well as their satisfaction with the intervention. Secondary objectives are to evaluate patient-related outcomes, cost-effectiveness of the interventions, and any unfavorable or undesirable outcomes that may arise.
   Methods: This systematic review will follow the methodology as described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. As our systematic review is one of a series of reviews on digital education for health professionals' education, we will use a previously developed search strategy. This search includes the following databases: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Cochrane Library), MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), Web of Science, the Educational Resource Information Centre (ERIC) (Ovid), PsycINFO (Ovid), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (EBSCO), the ProQuest Dissertation and Theses database, and trial registries. Databases will be searched for studies published from January 1990 to August 2018. Two independent reviewers will screen the library for included studies. We will describe the screening process using a flowchart as per the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We will extract the data using a previously developed, structured data extraction form. Included studies will be quality-assessed using the Risk of Bias tool from Cochrane. We will narratively summarize the data and, if possible, we will conduct a meta-analysis. We will use Cochrane's RevMan 5.3 software for data analysis.
   Results: We have completed the screening of titles and abstracts for this systematic review and are currently selecting papers against our inclusion and exclusion criteria through full-text revision. We are expecting to complete our review by the end of April 2019.
   Conclusions: This systematic review will provide an in-depth analysis of digital education strategies to train health care providers in the management of chronic wounds. We consider this topic particularly relevant given the current challenges facing health care systems worldwide, including shortages of skilled personnel and a steep increase in the population of older adults as a result of a prolonged life expectancy.

AB  - Purpose Healthcare employs informatics to offer its services through information technology where the social network can aid virtual medical learning. Since the usage of the internet and other electronic tools for medical services delivery is at the initial stage, it is essential to examine the factors that condition patients and medical elements in a virtual environment can develop relationship models on the health services. So, the authors have systematically reviewed virtual medical learning and offered some suggestions for the upcoming works. The authors have also discovered gaps in the state-of-the-art papers and provided solutions for them. Design/methodology/approach Numerous novel advancements have changed the old exercise of therapeutic and analytic learning. Virtual spaces have quickly turned into a section of the learning technology vision. Given the importance of its achievements and endless low-cost expansion of the educational system, virtual education has been considered as one of the issues raised by the information communities. Medicine and health are some of the most important fields in virtual technologies. Hence, in this paper, we have used a systematic literature review to deeply examine virtual medical learning. After establishing exclusion and inclusion criteria, an independent systematic search in Google Scholar, ACM, Scopus, Eric, Science Direct, Springer link, Emerald, Global ProQuest and IEEE for relevant studies have been performed, and 21 papers have been analyzed. Detailed data have been mined out of the papers. Findings The authors have found that virtual medical learning improves and expands the knowledge core and meaningfully affects the exercise. Virtual learning (VL) has been used in many therapeutic zones, like therapeutic learning, surgery, diagnosing, combining and regularizing processes. It has presented a fundamental access point and a referral mechanism for all of a course's component communities. It can also simplify communicative education, allowing learners to get abilities before applying them in a real-world situation. Also, the communicative characteristics of different VL programs can somehow be like direct teaching. Research limitations/implications Some excellent work may be removed owing to applying the filters to select the primary papers. Surveying all the documents on the topic of virtual medical learning is impossible, too. Nevertheless, the authors have tried to present a perfect survey of virtual medical learning. The results will be helpful for scholars to propose better virtual medical learning techniques. Practical implications E-learning has become an indispensable additional learning tool in medical education. The introduction of new learning technologies, the exponential growth of Internet usage and the advent of the World Wide Web can change the face of higher education. The results will be helpful for scholars for the upcoming works. The application of a literature review of partial least squares theory was useful for offering comprehensive literary coverage and completing the knowledge development analysis. The authors have backed scholars and experts for better understanding the development of virtual medical learning systems via presenting comparative data and scrutinizing the present advances. Originality/value The paper enhances intellectual knowledge by improving the conception of virtual medical learning. It informs the development, use of virtual medical learning and the upcoming works.
   The lack of comprehensive papers in this field has increased the importance of this paper.
   The present paper can handle the pace of publications.

AB  - Background: Effective communication skills are essential in diagnosis and treatment processes and in building the doctor-patient relationship.
   Objective: Our aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of digital education in medical students for communication skills development. Broadly, we assessed whether digital education could improve the quality of future doctors' communication skills.
   Methods: We performed a systematic review and searched seven electronic databases and two trial registries for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster RCTs (cRCTs) published between January 1990 and September 2018. Two reviewers independently screened the citations, extracted data from the included studies, and assessed the risk of bias. We also assessed the quality of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations assessment (GRADE).
   Results: We included 12 studies with 2101 medical students, of which 10 were RCTs and two were cRCTs. The digital education included online modules, virtual patient simulations, and video-assisted oral feedback. The control groups included didactic lectures, oral feedback, standard curriculum, role play, and no intervention as well as less interactive forms of digital education. The overall risk of bias was high, and the quality of evidence ranged from moderate to very low. For skills outcome, meta-analysis of three studies comparing digital education to traditional learning showed no statistically significant difference in postintervention skills scores between the groups (standardized mean difference [SMD]=-0.19; 95% CI-0.9 to 0.52; I-2=86%, N=3 studies [304 students]; small effect size; low-quality evidence). Similarly, a meta-analysis of four studies comparing the effectiveness of blended digital education (ie, online or offline digital education plus traditional learning) and traditional learning showed no statistically significant difference in postintervention skills between the groups (SMD=0.15; 95% CI-0.26 to 0.56; I-2=86%; N=4 studies [762 students]; small effect size; low-quality evidence). The additional meta-analysis of four studies comparing more interactive and less interactive forms of digital education also showed little or no difference in postintervention skills scores between the two groups (SMD=0.12; 95% CI:-0.09 to 0.33; I-2=40%; N=4 studies [893 students]; small effect size; moderate-quality evidence). For knowledge outcome, two studies comparing the effectiveness of blended online digital education and traditional learning reported no difference in postintervention knowledge scores between the groups (SMD=0.18; 95% CI:-0.2 to 0.55; I-2=61%; N=2 studies [292 students]; small effect size; low-quality evidence). The findings on attitudes, satisfaction, and patient-related outcomes were limited or mixed. None of the included studies reported adverse outcomes or economic evaluation of the interventions.
   Conclusions: We found low-quality evidence showing that digital education is as effective as traditional learning in medical students' communication skills training. Blended digital education seems to be at least as effective as and potentially more effective than traditional learning for communication skills and knowledge. We also found no difference in postintervention skills between more and less interactive forms of digital education. There is a need for further research to evaluate the effectiveness of other forms of digital education such as virtual reality, serious gaming, and mobile learning on medical students' attitude, satisfaction, and patient-related outcomes as well as the adverse effects and cost-effectiveness of digital education.
